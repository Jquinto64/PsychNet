"So the first line of this is wrong.  Our Minister of Health is not a doctor.

Our Minister of Health *was* a doctor until she was unceremoniously tossed out of the party by the piece of crap that is Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Look up the SNC-Lavalin Affair:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNC-Lavalin_affair

Don't be fooled by the smoke and mirrors of this cheap trick.  Behind the curtain of identity based appointments is a disgusting lack of respect, a lack of dignity, a lack of honesty that is the true black lying politicking heart of the Trudeau Liberals.

Our current Minister of Health is NOT a doctor.  And she has been acting quite strangely during this pandemic.

Only a few weeks ago, when it was becoming increasingly clear to the world that the Chinese Communist Party had deceived the world about aspects of the virus, she answered a question about whether the Chinese data could be trusted by rejecting the question and saying that asking it amounted to spreading ""conspiracy theories"".  Days later the CCP revised its death toll by 50%, and now more and more we are seeing how the CCP lied during the beginning of this whole thing.  She has since said that ""evidence has evolved"" in order to cover for her ridiculous answer.

In the halls of power behind these ministers - among the staffers and lawyers who run the government - there is a true rot of skeezeballs and deep incompetence.  These people in the ""storefront window"" are just for show.",Normal

They took power with a positive balance and turned out deficit after deficit since. Some laws passed are a direct attack against fair administration of justice and freedom of speech. All defence procurements were stalled for political reasons while the military equipment is falling apart (remember the purchase of 30yo used Australian fighters to replace 30yo used fighters, just because they promised not to purchase the F35).
They've been complacent with ISIS, first by retiring forces from the Middle-East as soon thwy took power, and then by refusing to do anything against returning ISIS fighters. They accepted Syrian refugees arms open, with the exeception of Christians, that were strictly limited.

Even seniors that are worth 8 figures get an extra $500 as of today? No conditions. Lots of fraud reported on CERB but still demanded to send the money out! Really?

For all these ""amazing"" cabinet members it has been very clear that many important files are not well managed due to incompetence or lack of experience. Many instances of tweeting out liberal ideals that hurts canadian business and farmers because they think super powers want to be told by some Canadian politician?

There will be a time when the money printing will have to turn off. Let's see how all these amazing politicians like Trudeau handle the pressure of not being able to afford the interest on the debt. Taxes are going up baby! It is coming sooner than later.

We had a little makeshift kitchen set up and for every meal the group would come together to cook. It warmed my heart to see that every night, whoever was cooking made sure to set aside a plate for our Muslim friend since we ate before sunset. Then several people would make sure he had breakfast ready for when he had to wake up before sunrise, sometimes people would make him sandwiches or set up a little basket with treats. Never once did he ask anyone to do any of it, people that he barely knew just wanted to help. Restored my faith in humanity a little",Normal

"I was the ‚Äúbaby‚Äù in a very similar circumstance. My grandmother had extremely late stage 4 cancer and was given days/weeks to live. My mother, her only daughter, was pregnant with me and grandma wasn‚Äôt having it. She lived another three months until I was born. My mom had me cesarean and had to be in the hospital for about a week. Once she was discharged she took me straight to grandma, who was in a nearby hospital. The staff told my mom that a baby couldn‚Äôt go in the room m, since back on the 70‚Äôs they probably thought it was contagious or something stupid like that. My mom freaked out,  but my grandpa remained calm and just told my mom to wait outside. My grandma was in a room on the first floor, so my grandpa quietly closed the door, pulled out a pocket knife and cut open the screen. He had my mom pass me in through the window screen so my grandmother could hold me. She slipped into a coma a few hours later and passed away. She literally waited for me. My whole life I‚Äôve been told how much I‚Äôm like my grandma, and her own sisters refer to me as her nickname... but I‚Äôll never know her. 

Whenever I‚Äôm asked ‚Äúif you could have a meal with one person‚Äù (or whatever variation) my answer will always be her. I don‚Äôt believe in god or heaven, but I want to so badly just for the glimmer of hope that I could meet her.

"‚ÄúI am looking straight at Canadians and being honest the way I always have,‚Äù Trudeau said.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve said we are committed to balanced budgets and we are. We will balance that budget in 2019.‚Äù

Now let‚Äôs consider what happened.

Trudeau said in 2015 if he was elected, his government would have a $9.9-billion deficit in the 2016-17 fiscal year, $9.5 billion in 2017-18, $5.7 billion in 2018-19 and a $1-billion surplus in the current fiscal year.

What Trudeau delivered was a $19-billion deficit in 2016-17, $19 billion in 2017-18, $14.9 billion in 2018-19 and a $19.8-billion deficit in the current fiscal year, when he said he‚Äôd have a $1-billion surplus.",Normal

Canada isn't some utopia where government is competent and social differences are non-existent. Self-loathing Americans and smug Canadians love to point out how non-American ( and therefore better ) Canada is when compared to their southern neighbour.

He nearly jumped out of his skin when I opened the door.  He returned my paper immediately, but berated me for getting two because I obviously (to him) only need one and he believed he shouldn't have to pay a quarter at the box to read a paper when I have 2.

"[Article at ladbible.com](https://www.ladbible.com/news/animals-loyal-dog-wont-leave-spot-where-owner-died-18-months-ago-20190715.amp.html) 

According to Nafpaktia News, the dog's owner was a 40-year-old man called Haris, who died on 9 November 2017 when he was hit by a cement mixer.

While no one's really quite sure how the pooch made it to the site of the crash, which is seven-and-a-half miles away from his home - Haris' four-legged pal has remained at the roadside ever since his tragic death.

Many locals have tried to adopt the heartbroken dog, but apparently he's having none of it and refuses to move from the site - even when the weather gets unbearably hot, he'll only ever go and plonk himself in the nearby bushes for some shade.

A few weeks ago I was up late playing D&D on roll20 (Online platform). My neighbor had his brother over. About 1:00AM his brother starts trimming a bush in my front yard outside the window I was sitting next to (window open). I asked what he was doing and my neighbor replied.

Beyond the fact that it was intrusive and weird, I think it would just be a bad idea for a black guy to be in someone else's yard without permission at 1:00 AM. I don't see anything good coming from that scenario, regardless of your race, but particularly if you're a black dude.",Normal

On the 50th anniversary of Woodstock while i was having my own yard sale I met a man and found out that went there for his honeymoon. As we were talking he told me that he used to own the Woodstock Album but had lost it And wished he had had it back. I told him wait a second I believe i might have the same record. When i came back and handed it to him his face lit up and then looked very confused I asked him if it was the record his said yes It's exactly the record. I said ya i don't believe there was another one made. he said No this is My old record. And pointed to the top right corner. Where his name and his old address and phone # were. So i said well i guess it's yours.

"This appears to be an old meme. The minister of health is not a doctor because he fired the last minister of health for sticking up for the integrity of the minister of justice - the one listed as a former crown prosecutor and a first nations leader? He fired HER because she refused to exempt a company that donated a lot of money to Trudeau's campaign and employed people in his riding from prosecution for ... bribery. In fact, not too dissimilar from how Trump fired his own attorney general. Now let's see, oh, the minster of defense is a sikh veteran... not so much. He was in the reserves, true, but never a regular and never saw combat. Then after he was appointed minister of defense he got caught lying about his achievements in Afghanistan and taking credit for other people's work. Whoops. The disabled Minister of Sport is not a disabled person or a paralympian. That was the previous guy, who was fired because some woman complained that fifteen years or so ago he hit on her in an elevator, which made her feel uncomfortable. The minister of finance was a successful businessman in the same sort of way Donald Trump was. That is, he grew up rich and worked in daddy's company.",Normal

"The implication of this is facile nonsense and we should be able to spot it a mile away.

The idea that it's **essential** for the head of a government department to have held a position in some field related to it is absurd. Can it be *useful* for such a person to have had direct experience in that field? Sure, maybe. But it isn't and shouldn't be a *prerequisite* for consideration any more than having been a telecom engineer should be a prerequisite for getting appointed CEO of a telecom company.

Many people don't seem understand that the head of a government department is a bureaucrat whose job centers on their ability to inspire, organize, appoint and delegate. You don't actually *do* any of the work implied by the title of your department at all; you rely on the expertise of those under you to inform the decisions you're charged with making. Anyone who's worked for at least a medium-sized company - which is a fairly large proportion of people - should already know this.

Seriously, how does having been an *astronaut* (to pick one of the more ridiculous examples) qualify a person to be Minister of Transport? ""Well, hurr, astronauts go zoom-zoom in a type of, whadayacallit, *transportation*, durr!""

Please.

This is just box-checking for stupid people, isn't it? It's not about skill and ability to do the actual job that a department head does. It's about making people who are ignorant of the process of government think, ""Oh yes, that's just obvious common sense. I like this Prime Minister! He makes excellent decisions!""

"The justice minister referred to here is Jody Wilson Raybould and she was let go after becoming a whistle blower in a scandal involving a large construction consultation firm called SNC Lavalin.

Long story short SNC used capital generated through public tender work in Canada to bribe themselves into contracts in Libya which goes against certain Canadian laws regarding corruption and eligibility for public tender.  Breaking these laws would constitute a 10 year ban from public tender work and I'm sure a bunch of fines and possible jail time etc.

PM Trudeau pressured JWB into seeking a deferred prosecution agreement for SNC which would essentially allow them to continue operating business as usual.  Add on the fact that SNC aggressively lobbied senior members of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government to create a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) regime in hopes of avoiding any legal ramifications of their alleged corruption.  He did this under the guise of ""protecting Canadian jobs"", but in reality SNC Lavalin had over 4 Billion dollars worth of back orders which they would have been allowed to continue with regardless of whether or not they received a DPA.  

When JWB refused to seek a DPA Trudeau began threatening her position as a means of pressuring her further into seeking a DPA.  She recorded a conversation she had with the clerk of the privy council Michael Wernick in which he uses veiled language to imply that not seeking a DPA would result in her losing her position.  She went public with it and Trudeau claimed breach of trust as a reason to let her go.  Keep in mind this is all after he claimed to be building a gender equal and diverse cabinet.

To me this proves that Trudeau doesn't give two shits about gender equality, diversity OR credentials because JWR definitely had the credentials and was an Indigenous Woman.  He used identity politics to pay lip service to many who drank it up like the fountain of youth before they voted for him, and when this scandal was happening those same people couldn't care to take an hour and read about what was actually happening before it got swept under the rug just in time for them to vote for Trudeau again.

Canada is far from perfect and I think a post like this is just propaganda designed to make the US look bad meanwhile we have many problems like they do we just aren't under a worldwide microscope everyday.",Normal

"Ran into Brian Altano on the BART before the Switch came out, before the public even knew what it was. He seemed to know all the details. Was jealous.

I still miss the original Nintendo guard at IGN - Matt Cassamassina, Bozon, Craig Harris, etc. - but Brian was one of the few people at IGN who seemed to legit enjoy Nintendo games, back when most of the industry was ripping on them. And now Nintendo's back in full force!",Normal

What a lucky neighbor! I lived in a studio on the UWS of manhattan for a short time. My neighbor was an elderly man who played on a daily basis. I often would wake up on Saturday mornings to gentle concertos drifting over from his living room. I cherished those moments of peace before my days started. I later learned he was a retired concert pianist - it was truly a privilege to live next to him.,Normal

"Ive ended up with a lot of autistic people as friends online, I just click with them. They‚Äôre pretty great. In a lot of ways to me it seems that really the biggest problem for autistic people is the prejudices.

If people were more accepting, I think it would solve a lot of the problems they face. but that‚Äôs just an outsider‚Äôs perspective; certainly it helps regardless.",Normal

"Our Minister of Health is not a doctor. Maybe this graphic is put on the current Cabinet photo? Original cabinet Dr. Jane Phillpot was Minister of Health. I didn't get beyond the first item and knew it was wrong.

[Current Minister of Health Patty Nadju info from Wiki:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Hajdu)

**Early life and education**

Born in Montreal, she spent her early years in Chisholm, Minnesota with her brother Sean Patrick Hajdu (1969-2003), raised by her aunt and uncle.[4] Her Hungarian last name comes from her stepfather.

At 12 years old, Hajdu moved to Thunder Bay to live with her mother. Due to a tumultuous relationship, she ended up living on her own at age 16, attempting to finish high school.[4] After graduating high school, she got a job in Thunder Bay through an employment-insurance initiative, at a non-profit adult-literacy group, where she trained in graphic design.[4]

Hajdu then attended Lakehead University, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts.[4] In 2015, she received a Master of Public Administration from the University of Victoria.[5][6]",Normal

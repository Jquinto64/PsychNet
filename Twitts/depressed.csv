"I'm new here. I had depression in high school, but I think I might be starting to relapse due to life circumstances. I lost my job in November and have been doggedly pursuing other opportunities, but I keep failing to make any traction at all. I'm 25, I have no full-time job, no boyfriend, no place to call my  own and I really don't have anything else going for me. I'm struggling to find the motivation to go back to school but I just feel foggy, weighed down by everything, and like an utter failure. I hope I can find a home here.",Depressed
I told myself I didn't want to live to see my 30th birthday. Today was my 30th birthday and I don't know why I'm still here.,Depressed
"I miss being young and fearless, the age when I took every risk necessary and put actual effort into achieving my goals and career. Now after years of failures and economic struggle my fear cripples me and doesn't let me advance, my confidenc is non-existent and the stagnation is killing me. I don't know if I should live to suffer anymore.",Depressed

"I've been in a real rut lately.

  About a year ago things were going great.  I started college, found a girlfriend who lived in my apartment complex.  Everything was amazing.  I had never really been in a serious relationship, and it satisfied a need that I didn't know that I had; intimacy.  Not sexual but just having someone who you know really cares about you.  I've never really had a close friend and I learned how amazing that was.

Anyways, I fell in love with her.  And I thought that she was feeling the same way.  She eventually told me that she loved me and that she could see herself marrying me.  

In less than 2 weeks after she told me that she loved my she dumped me out of the blue.  She gave me a story about how she couldn't love anyone because of a tramatic experience she had just before we meet.  About how she was abused and needed to get help.

I tried to be understanding.  But it pained me that the person that I loved was struggling but the only way to heal was to distance themself from me.  I agreed to stay friends and to be there for her as she got help.

Within the week she was dating again.  She was flirting with my roommates and being really touchy-feely with them in front of me.  I was confused and hurt.  I saw that she had put a profile up on the local dating apps.  Eventually our mutual friends told me that she had been talking shit behind my back and that she wasn't struggling, she just didn't want to be with me anymore.

She's now married to one of my former friends, I changed schools because I couldn't stand to see her flaunting herself in front of me everyday.  And it's been over a year since then.

I no longer feel the same way about her but, I feel like she tore my heart out and I never got it back.  Sometimes I'm doing something happy and I just get this wave of cold, dark hopelessness out of nowhere.  I don't even really think of her anymore but I can't shake this feeling of intense loneliness.  I have 2 buddies that I hang out with, but I have no one that I can talk to about how I am.  

My self worth is horrible, I genuinely hate myself.  I isolate myself because I feel like I'm bothering everyone just by being me and I'm afraid that if I open up to anyone that they will just rip my heart out again.

Now I'm in school again, but I can't find the motivation to go to class.  I can't tell my family that, because then I'll have to explain how I am feeling.  So I just sit in my truck for hours and come home once ""school"" is out.  




Sorry this was long, but I have a lot of things in my mind and no one to tell it to.  This seemed like a good place to write it out

Thank you.",Depressed
Hahaha. Idk what to do anymore. Life is a fucking landmine where I step on all the traps. And I’m ready to fuck off from it.,Depressed
another day to wake up again. another day to pretend to be everything’s okay when i’m home. another day to pretend i have an appetite when i have none. another day of 9 hours at work and 3 hours at commute and not talking to anyone. another day of returning home pretending everything’s okay. another day of pretending that i have friends when i have none. another day to wonder how much vitality i have left with all these pretending...,Depressed
I want to stop existing. It's too painful.,Depressed
Making close friends is difficult,Depressed
"I seriously don’t understand my fellow wage slaves who are not depressed. You have to trade off most of your waking hours daily only to be able to feed and shelter yourself just to sustain your servitude for the capitalist next day, week, month, year, your entire lifetime. Your weekends have lost all meanings because you have to prepare for the next week of another grind by doing laundry or whatever so you’re too tired to do anything remotely fun. Hell, you don’t even recognize fun anymore even if it smashes your balls with a shit covered shovel.

How could you not be depressed. And how is it my illness when it’s only natural to be depressed in this situation. Why am I a sick one when the world is the actually a sick place.

Find something you can enjoy. Try new things. Read books. Travel. Be positive. Look at the bright side and ignore dark sides. Eat something delicious. Spend money on things and experience that enrich your life.

What a load of bullshit. I’ve done all of those things and they didn’t change anything and I still permanently have to sell my only resource which is my limited healthy years of my short life for the price of merely to be able to exist on this miserable earth.

I’m so over with trying to squeeze out a nanogram of fake happiness from temporary respite. I’m truly unfit to be a wage slave.",Depressed
my brain feels fried,Depressed
"This seems like a dumb question, but I'm not sure what 'self care' *is* at this point. Or 'self love', for that matter. Isn't loving yourself the definition of being egotistical? I'm seriously *not* making fun of this; it's something I hear all the time. I mean, I understand that I hate myself, and that isn't helping anything, but shouldn't it be more 'self like' than 'self love'?",Depressed
I loath myself and want to die. I hear this in my head more than anything else these days. It's a self destructive mantra.,Depressed

"Seriously, if I get told to smile, cheer up or to be friendly one more fucking time, I'm going to lose it. Seriously, I've just been told that just because I'm depressed, it doesn't mean I have to always act depressed. WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?! I need sing and fucking dance for their benefit? Maybe I don't smile a lot because nothing makes me smile. Nothing is causing genuine happiness or smiling. I hardly speak because I either have nothing to say or I can't find it in myself to be expressive. I'm sick of feeling attacked and judged for how I'm feeling.",Depressed
It sucks to be wide awake when you've lost interest in everything,Depressed
"I’m tired of breakdowns. I’m tired of not having money. I’m tired of being so ill physically and mentally to the point of not being able to work.

"When will I enjoy things again? My life is so pathetic and I can't be bothered changing it either. Every day that goes by I'm glad it's gone. I wish someone would come and wrap their arms around me and tell me everything is taken care of and I don't need to worry about anything anymore. Why the fuck am I even here - why do I exist. This experience called ""Life"" is horseshit. Wish I was never born.",Depressed
"How is anyone continuing? I don’t understand. The world has come to an abrupt halt, yet we are trying to squeeze more productivity out of sick workers. I’m mentally drained, I cannot go on for the next 40 years with the chance of maybe retiring. 

This health crisis has made it even more apparent there is no escape from the drudgery. Basically the way I see it, I have a very marginal chance to make my life better, but it could get a fuck load worse. Fuck I hate the way life is, I’m just not cut out for this. 

On top of all this I have completely lost all sense of smell and taste from COVID. One of my only real passions is cooking, and i never realized how much happiness I got from those senses before. My life is a dull grey wet newspaper, and I’m being force-fed until I expire.

Tldr: I’m not doing so hot right now.",Depressed
"I had a horrible panic attack at work and almost called an ambulance to admit me to the hospital.. but it passed.  Dealing with a lot of suicidal thoughts on a daily basis.  I feel trapped and don't see an exit, but if I hold out long enough I might find one.  I'm getting so tired though",Depressed
"Parents like to humiliate me while just passing by. ""Reminding"" me about ""having a talk"" tomorrow which is more me being forced to report. They are _absolutely_ naive, incredibly harmful and still want to tell me what to do. 

I just love getting berated by the people who 1, made me ill in the first place (when I was ten) 2, kept me from seeking help 3, still destroy my mental health today but ofc ""iTs oNlY mEaNt WeLl"". 

I hate them _so much_. I am so angry on them but I have absolutely no fucking spine, I am overwhelmed with literally anything, I am still dependent on them and can't deal with all this.  I don't even want to ask them for a tissue. They've fucking destroyed enough of my life. 

Struggling with suicidal thoughts and other issues. Wishing not to exist is my highest goal. I have no will to get better anymore and I haven't for a long time, I told my last therapist and she was like ""well that's your problem bud"". Just want to fucking destroy this existence. 

Selfharming again.",Depressed
I feel myself slipping away. I am so consumed by pain and I can barely hold it together. I think I might die tonight.,Depressed
"I've been punching myself a lot recently, can be from thinking about how much of a failure I feel like, how shit with money I am, how I couldn't make a relationship with the best guy I've ever met work, or how I feel like I'm wasting my life, also from just stupid things I've done. I can't afford a therapist. How the hell can I stop myself from doing this? I've got a dull headache now and I feel like punching myself again",Depressed
I'm a failure and a weakling. I'm so numb.,Depressed
"I feel so alone, so isolated, even though I know I have people in my life that love me. Nothing I do makes me happy anymore. I get joy out of nothing. My life is a repeating cycle of waking up, going to school, going home, sleeping, repeat. I don’t see the point in living anymore when all I have in life is sadness. The only thing keeping me around is the fact that I don’t want to make my parents sad that I’ve died.",Depressed

"Everything is terrible. I wake up every day hopeless and miserable. Its all too hard, why is it so hard? I try my absolute best but it isn't enough, my efforts are always met with judgment and derision. I try to smile but people can tell it isn't genuine, I can feel when people are unnerved by me and it makes me very sad. 

My mind doesn't cooperate with me, I'm always forgetting and making mistakes. I can't learn anything, or regulate my emotions. Its always the same trip on the hamster wheel. 

I want to be alone but I'm lonely. I want to love her but I don't know how. The worst part is she didn't reject me, she keeps me around but I know she is cheating on me and waiting for a better option, at which point she will leave. However I won't because I can never find anybody like her who would want to be with me.


I'm fucking out of here. People act like they don't want you to die, but you're supposed to live a hard terrible life? The only thing that makes me happy is thinking about checking out, why can't I have that?",Depressed
"People think I'm happy and well adjusted because I'm a nice and likeable guy. Because I'm personable and I'm everybody's friend. 

Truth is I always try so fucking hard to make everyone feel as good as I want to feel. I've felt happiness here and there in the past 10 yrs. But it's always taken over by thoughts of me wanting to end it.

I keep finding goals to distract myself and make it feel like I'm working towards something. But at the end of every day I feel completely empty and lonely as all hell. 

My friends are there sometimes. And they're a great help when they can be around. But again, at the end of the day. I'm alone and feel lonely as hell. 

I'm successful in getting relationships when I want them. I'm likeable, see. But sooner or later they get bored or get to know me too well. 

The last person that I let myself get hurt by told my i was amazing in so many ways. And that being with her, she was only going to drag me down. Which confused the fuck out of me. 

The next person I was attracted to their personality because they were everything my last ex wasn't.  They supported me in everything. I just wasn't physically attracted and that sucked. So I broke it off. 

Now my last two relationships have been long distance and where I know I can do it. My previous ex couldn't. She wanted sex. Which is fine. My head just gets fucked up when someone tells me they love me. That's all I ever wanted. 

My current girlfriend was amazing. She seemed like she cared, I'm attracted to her and she's just amazing. But i can feel that she's going to break it off soon. I know the feeling. 

I dont know what it is about me that makes people want to leave. They love me initially. But after a few months. Nobody stays. Nobody. 

I dont now what I'm ranting about anymore. Just needed a vent. That's all. 
If you actually read all of this. Thanks, it means things. 

Everybody loves me, but nobody likes me.

"Bad

Recognizing that I need to put in more effort to save myself, but not having the energy or will to actually do it. Maybe I'm scared of getting better?

I'm such a failure already, it would take so much more work to turn my life around than it would to just accept where I'm at and continue to suffer. I know that will hurt the people who love me. Is it selfish to just lie down anyways? I don't feel like I have a choice.

Tired of fighting.",Depressed

Waking up from an afternoon nap like I'm getting out of a coma. There's a split second before I remember how awful my life is.,Depressed
"I think I've been depressed for a while. I'm not sure when it started, but I stopped doing things that need to be done, that a responsible person would just do. I know they need to be done, but the longer I put them off the harder it becomes to do them.

At this point my motivation to do things is low. I'm beginning not to even want to play my favorite games. 

Last Monday I was told to be tested for Covid -19. When I was on my way to the clinic a man pulled out in front of me and totaled my car. So I got tested at the emergency room. And then I was quarantined until I get my results. Which will probably be another 10 days. Since I no longer have a car I can't even do grocery pickup. They don't deliver here. I can still order online, but I have to rely on other people to pick them up and bring them to me.

They are trying to settle for an amount that won't buy me a new car the same quality as the one I had. It was 14 years old, so it wasn't worth a lot, but I'm only finding cars that are older than mine to buy. I'm being pressured to give it up so they don't have to pay storage, but I can't get my things out of it. The people who could help me work when the shop is open. The other option is go get my things afterwards. It is a four hour round trip. 

I can't even shop for a car right now. Not really. I can look, but no dealer is going to let me test drive now, nor would I want them to. It's not worth the risk. I can't ask them to hold anything for me; I can't offer a deposit. I don't have the means to travel cross-country to get one. The settlement is so small it would mean getting a significantly worse car.

I feel angry, stuck, and helpless. I'm an introvert and prefer being home, but even so, I'm starting to feel isolated.

The good news is, I'm not very sick. I have a cough that is sometimes productive. My chest occasionally burns. Sometimes I'm short of breath, but I think the worst is behind me. I am able to work from home, so I've only missed two days from illness and the accident. My printer broke, so I'm having to be creative, but my work can be done on a screen and I'm managing. I've made a ""stamp"" for my signature so I can still sign documents.

I live in a small community. I can walk to my job and to most of the places I need to go. Not having a car is certainly inconvenient, but I could probably manage the most routine parts of my life independently, and there are people who could help with the rest. Plus, with Covid, my doctors are doing telemedicine, so I don't need to drive to see them. 

My life isn't bad. I should be grateful. So many people have it worse than me. So many people don't have a job. I'm alive and relatively undamaged. I need a car, but not desperately. But, yeah.",Depressed
"Just broke up with my girlfriend because she wants to see other people. Lost the only thing I really care about in this world and secretly getting drunk while living in a sober home surrounded by people who I can’t relate to.

"Honestly having the worst time in my life right now. The lockdown had a big impact on my mental and physical health, as well as my finances. 
Then my dad was having health problems back at home, and I needed to call ambulances to check on him. First it was a stroke and head injury, then difficulty breathing which became diagnosed as Pneumonia, and then we received news that he was going to pass very soon due to kidney failure. 
I had to kind of break quarantine restrictions in my city to go back to my hometown so I could see my dad in hospital. Sadly he was asleep and already being given fluids to help him relax, and he passed away an hour after we left the hospital.
Now my mother and I have to deal with the aftermath of his passing. We're arranging a private burial for him, which we have to sort out the payment for. Then I have to meet with the lawyer about his will, which he was in the process of finishing a new one but it was left unsigned. Then I have to help my mother get on a benefit. We're a low income family and dad didn't give permission to mum before he died to access his savings, so we're going to be a financially fought spot, and my mother can't really deal with the paperwork since she's not fluent in English.
All the while, I have essays I need to finish at University, and life just sucks at the moment, and I'm just thinking it may be time to just give up. My whole life has felt like a struggle, like I wasn't even meant to be alive and life is trying it's damn hardest to ensure I stop trying. I'm going to do everything I can for my mother, but I'm about ready to give up. 
I just feel tired and numb now.",Depressed
Day 18 post breakup. Thinking about him made me heavily depressed today but the pain in my chest wasn’t that bad. I finally think I’m getting over the really terrible part of grieving. I’m now forgetting how many days it’s been since the breakup like I said I wanted in one of my earlier check-ins. I completed one of my assignments finally. I’m so glad my professor extended the due date by one day. For the rest of the day I looked for resources on getting over a breakup again. I feel like I already know what to do but hearing the same advice explained differently sort of makes me feel better when I listen to it. Now I’m playing an old video game. Ocarina of time’s great fairy’s fountain theme has been in my head since the middle of the day.,Depressed
"i’m not doing great.

i’m sure everyone is struggling due to the quarantine and i’m for sure included. i’m in high school and i take medicine for my ADHD and depression. 

be fore quarantine my life was finally starting to feel good, i was doing well in school, i had stable and happy relationships w friends and family, i was playing lacrosse and working out everyday, i would wake up excited for my life. Of course i was still struggling sometimes but for the most part, life was good!

Now i’m stuck in my house with my toxic family and doing schoolwork is becoming increasingly difficult.

i’ve had an addiction to nicotine for almost a year, but i cannot buy any due to corona. i know this is good for me so i can quit but it’s making my mood so much worse. in the beginning of quarantine i was smoking weed occasionally and it helped me SO MUCH but i ran out and that’s not an option anymore.

anyways i guess i just wanna say that it’s been getting a lot harder to be happy and covid has absolutely fucked me over.

If anyone want to talk about things that make them happy i would love to hear! i need some human interaction that isn’t negative, and i love hearing what makes other people smile. i’m struggling rn and i know others are too, let’s try and be there for each other :-)",Depressed

Our employer said that we should be happy because we'll be making slightly more on unemployment than we would normally through our job, but I just want to be working again. I know many people have it much worse than I do, but depression doesn't care.",Depressed
"I don't really mind the lockdown as I stay home quite often. My mental health deteriorated last week and I've been crying at night. It's just triggered by the fact that I absolutely hate my job although I know I'm lucky to have one during the crisis.

I can’t sleep, I’m physically ill, and the worst part is... they’re distancing themselves and I know soon, they just ... won’t be in my life anymore. 

All I want is their happiness, so I’m trying desperately hard to stop being so overly attached. I’m trying to just ... cease communication and let them be the first to reach out when they’re ready, but the voice in my head tells me that they never will. And it’s probably right.

Talking to my parents just leads to them getting exasperated and asking me why I can't just be happy since I have a pretty good life. Talking to my one friend who isn't busy all the time just leads to him talking over me 75% of the time. 

Seeing all those people happily preparing for the Stupor Bowl and Valentine's Day with their friends, partners and family members just makes my life feel so much emptier and more meaningless.

They're just barely starting to pick up the pieces now and I think about how doing that would be too much for them. I find myself angry at my brother because he ""took"" the one way out so now I can't.

Like many people here, I'm not sad most of the time, I just...don't feel like doing anything. I'm gaining weight that I had previously lost last year (lost 60lbs, now gained back 45lbs) because one of my only vices is food. Got meds a few months ago for anxiety which seems to have helped but in the meanwhile the depression has gotten worse. I know I need to see someone about it but I keep putting it off.

I'm hanging on to the facade that I've created, very few people in my life know there's any kind of issue. But at this point I'm barely hanging on to it, and I feel like soon it'll all come crumbling down. 

Just rambling, had to get this off my chest. Thanks for being here y'all.",Depressed

I feel like I manage to pull myself together every so often, today is one of those days, and then when people see me it’s like- the fact that I tried to look good today invalidates my depression and makes it a joke to them.

Even the lady who cut my hair yesterday noticed something was up. I guess I had started to think about what's going wrong and had a really concerned expression.

In reality I wanted to break down and cry...""no, nothing's okay. Nothing is fine.

I really hate how I'm living rn, my brother is an addict and I feel guilty as fuck whenever I do drugs when I party. I'm just living too fast at the moment, I need someone or something to calm me down and something that takes away the feeling that I need to get fucked up once a week to clear my head.

"Fuck this place...earth, life...the internet. Not quite this sub but if it's something that had even the most remote influence on me being brought into this life then fuck it too.

I pretty much wasted my day trying to actually not waste another day in bed....I've realized that all effort is futile, there is no point in trying to do anything and whether I'm in the house, in my bed, in the car, in a park, in a coffeeshop, in my head or in a city far away from my house, it doesn't change SHIT.

Everything is so dreadfully boring. Literally so boring. I have this sick joke going with myself where I repeat this ""mantra"" that goes ""there's fun to be found in doing things just for the fun of it--just because"" and I have yet to find fun in doing things just because. Going to a park no longer does shit for me. Going outside fucking sucks. Yoga fucking sucks. Making a whole ass meal fucking sucks...calling my friends suck ass. Seeing my family sucks ass. 

If it's me that is making everything seem terrible, I can handle that and I can accept that as truth and say sayonara to everything, while accepting that I'm to blame for the bullshit way I see things and give up trying to find a loophole through my misery. If the way I see things is actually because everything is so depressing and I don't have rose-colored glasses for life, then I'll accept that too...but like, universe...kill me off at least. Why make me miserable with you? And if you can't kill me off then give me the strength to do it myself. 

I hate asking. Maybe it's futile to ask you of anything. Been asking you for some relief, some peace, some contentment....some guidance....something that means something to me. A gift isn't a gift if it's an actual detriment to the receiver...and you keep giving me shit. Give me what I ask for maybe? To never wake up again, to check out of this hotel room in hell forever?

I should expect nothing more from you. You can't give me greatness and you also seem to not be able to give me death. Why even try to reason with you anymore....

My plan is to overdose. I've been stockpiling drugs of all kinds from some people I know and my plan is to get so wasted out of my mind that there is no second-guessing...that I get so belligerently reckless that I don't stop to think about anything that could keep me here, that it takes away any inclination towards self-preservation. I want to stop feeling, I want to feel my body and soul break away from each other and know I never have to consider a single thing that I ever once experienced in this life. I want to do it but I just haven’t been able to and it fucking sucks...

I want bile to consume me, pain to swallow me and the perception of consciousness to subside.

I take adderall off brand for depression because anti-depressants make me suicidal. I think I’m possibly bi-polar. He is maybe addicted to adderall now.

"I thought it was gonna be the end the last couple days, but here we are again, so I guess not.

I don't know why I didn't follow through. Day to day it's generally anger--something I want to prove to myself and shove down the universe's throat before going on to live a life I believe I should be able to live. Other times it's rationalising that if life's so pointless and full of pain, what's the point of death. There's something after, or there's not. Eternity of life or void, I doubt I'll give much of a shit about a few more years living in a dump like this; and maybe something will change. Every once in a while, I can briefly pull off finding something about this world I love. Or I'll just distract myself. Sometimes, despite my issues with Fate, I like to think that we all have a destined time to die, and until that moment the last tendrils of air leave your breast, we are to fight. Fight what, I'm not sure, but I'll be dammed if I'm gonna quit.

*Whatever.* The baseline point I'm trying to make here, is that I was sure it was my time, the end of my string. And... I dunno, I ran away and feel like a coward for it? That doesn't make a lick of sense. Suppose I wish I knew why I didn't off myself, because it sure as hell wasn't one of my normal reasons. It never is when I'm the closest to death.

Fuck, mostly I just wish this was over. I'm so goddamn tired of this bullshit. Part of me wants to just delete this crap and shoot myself, who cares what poor bastard has to clean me up. The other half hates me for even considering that, and wants to go find a post to bust the skin over my knuckles against.

"Hey All, I’m new to this community and thought I’d share my current thoughts: 

Sometimes I feel ashamed for just feeling depressed. I have a successful job in finance, I have a boyfriend, I live at home with my parents currently in which I have a great relationship. Everything on the surface equates to what should be a normal, stable life. 

However, I still sleep with carry this sadness with me that doesnt seem to go away. This feeling is invoked and emphasized when I get too into my own thoughts. I acknowledge that I do have a poor self image of myself as I constantly tell my boyfriend I do not feel like I look good enough to be with him or anyone in matter of fact. He tells me he wants to reevaluate our needs and wants in our relationship but I think he’s just prepping me to break up. It makes sense, I carry alot of baggage and him seeing me this way would probably turn most people away anyways. 

Lately, and often, I’ve been having a lot of suicidal dreams and fantasies about achieving some kind of happiness when I’m dead and I’m not even afraid if these thoughts. As off as it sounds, these thoughts are very comforting to me.

People won't suffer over it, please. If they cared they'd prove it. I'm rambling because I can't think straight I'm just over everything. I don't want to be here anymore. I am not happy, content, I'm not even comfortable. I'm just miserable and occasionally numb...",Depressed

"I’m having a rough weekend. My brain fog was heavy yesterday and the idea of dumping my boyfriend popped out of nowhere. I’ve been with him for years, he makes me happy, and my life is immeasurably better with him in it. It’s not how I feel 99% of the time. It only pops into my head when I’m feeling terrible. It’s the depression talking. The thought is still lingering today even though it’s not how I feel. There’s a nasty part of me that wants to sabotage myself for the sake of... I have no idea. I have to be careful, just stay quiet because I don’t trust my filter 100%",Depressed
"A mentor of mine has suspected that I was depressed right around December. Quick background story, I am not a people person. Kept a tight circle of friends when I was in school, no more than 3, and even then, I never felt like I needed any. In March of 2018, I was made a cashier at Walshart, despite me protesting that I'm better somewhere that doesn't require me to chit chat. 

 After enduring 6 months of Karens, low-lives, and geriatric cunts, I reached my breaking point when I was demoted from cashier to maintenance. Now I've listened to people's shit when they felt like rambling. I've bagged people's shit and put it in the cart for them because they were too bothered to move their fat asses five steps. But I will never, not in a million years, clean up anyone's shit. I thank all the janitors & custodians who can, but I can't do something so dehumanizing. I was told that it was either that or find another job. They were quite surprised when I didn't show up the next day. 

 I wasn't sure I hated people before I worked there, but now I certainly do. I've been without a job for a while now. I can't bring myself to beg for one, and I can't surround myself with people anymore.
So what happened that made me post this? My step dad is trying to weasel his way back into our lives. I say our because my mother is my world and I'm not sharing her with anyone. 

 To keep a long story short, my childhood was miserable because I had to deal with this degenerate every single day. My father was never in my life. Sometimes I want to reach out, but I have too much pride and there's always the fear of rejection/no answer. 

 It'll be a cold day in hell before I go through that again. But here's the thing. My mom is an idiot. I love her (I think), but she is stupid. She doesn't see character, morals, or intellect, only looks.  I'm sick of it. She knew in the past how I felt about him and she's surprised that I still feel this way. He came over yesterday and I stayed in my room the entire time. Missed dinner. Haven't talked to my mother since. Don't know if I can. My mind has been doing gymnastics, asking things like ""what if he's here to stay for good?"" ""What if he wants to get back together?"" I can't hide in my room like a shut-in forever. It's killing me that this could happen and I can't stop thinking about it. There's literally nothing worse that could happen.

 I try to turn off my feelings, try to pretend that I don't care, but there's still a bit of me that can't do that. I'm a cold motherfucker, I've cut off and shut out a lot of people, but I can't do that to my mom. But I won't live in the same house as someone who has caused me more than enough misery.

 Now I'm going to pretend I never wrote this.",Depressed
"My three-day-off scheduling is winding down and I am already so sad to have to go back out into the world. Started my new job last week, it's a physical-labor heavy job that pays better than what my old job did but I started having thoughts about this job on my last day of the work-week and it was only my first week! I'm too impulsive when it comes to leaving jobs and it's because I just don't care to be outside. 

I've spent my off days for the majority of it sitting at my desk, online and playing Sims. I didn't even realize how much time had passed last night and managed to stay up until 4:30am playing games. It's not like I would've done anything different, I knew I didn't want to go anywhere or see anyone and I had spent Friday actually doing things like chores, errands, etc. so in my mind I had all day to spend/waste it however I wanted. But I'm bummed that I can't have more time to spend...doing nothing essentially.

I don't know how to feel or what to say. I feel like a broken record that keeps being played. I'm both bored of doing nothing and bored of doing everything else and the feelings are always always temporary except for those associated with depression. I wonder, day in and out, whether I'm just making excuses for myself or creating a narrative in my mind that I'm sick or unusually sad and that the debilitation that I feel isn't anything that I can't control if I just tried to actually do something about it.

I am isolating myself. My phone's off because I can't afford to pay it and honestly it's a relief because I'm sick of talking to people when I feel as though I have nothing to share. Nothing new to say when they ask ""how are you?"", ""how was your week?"", ""what'd you get into this weekend""...

UMMMM....wine, microwavable burritos...Sims 4....insomnia....coffee and upset stomachs. Oh, and popcorn. That's all. I'm tired.

I wanted to try to cut myself for the first time this weekend. It's something that I TRIED to get myself to do in order to see if I felt any different and you know what? Right before wanting to do it, I got a splinter and the stupid thing hurt enough to make me realize my pain tolerance is too shit to talk myself into self-harm. That's just me. I realize it's stupid, objectively, to try to actively force yourself to hurt and that's a microcosm of literally everything that I know is so detrimental about mental illness or depression. But yet....my knife is still near my bed. I have two razor blades waiting in my bag and I don't think I'll ever honestly use them but...

It just goes to show. I'm out of my mind and I feel embarrassed about it. I feel absolutely idiotic for things that I do and the way that I think and the things I don't do or act upon and it's too much. When I try to ignore these thoughts, they come back with a vengeance and it takes either substance abuse or sleep to combat it. I hate therapy, I hate medication, I hate suicide hotlines, I hate talking about all of this with everyone because nobody is able to help, nobody knows what to say or do and it's all a guessing game and that's how it is for everything and when I think of that, it makes me want to end everything.

But I can't because pain tolerance, fight or flight...survival. It's like LV and HP fighting....though I feel as though my depression will somehow end up being Harry Potter by the end of it and winning out against life, LV. I'm not a HP fan like that but I imagine my will to live and my will to die are like that one scene in the graveyard, two forces that are constantly battling against each other. 

It fucking sucks to be alive and I feel like shit for saying that. It's like....either you stop complaining about it or you do something about it. I'm trying. I don't wear seatbelts anymore. I do really dangerous things, like mixing alcohol with pills...I'm ignoring potentially fatal bodily conditions all in the hopes that I will actually just fall over one day or go to sleep and not wake up.

Be easier than my family finding me in my closet. It'd also be easier on myself...

And I want shit to be easy but it's never going to be easy so why can't I just fucking kill myself already??????????????????? I can't make the world bend to me so why not go out with a bang, a big middle finger to it and the universe and everyone who ever lied and said this was worth it. I don't believe it. I don't believe anything anyone says....life sucks and it's not worth the pain or trauma or despair. I know what I need to do....I just need to force myself to do it.",Depressed

"I’m 34 next month.

The first 3 years I wasn’t online and not making memories. Next 3 years I was bouncing around neighbors and relatives’ arms because both of my parents worked full time. The first sexual abuse happened to me during those years.

Then I went to school for 18 years from elementary school to university preparing for employment. Never enjoyed studying what I had to study. School life was all about the vomit inducing anxiety and brief relief immediately following the each of the exam. I loved drawing but my parents literally threw away my sketchbooks and art supplies because art was distracting me from studying “important subjects”. 

Then soon after college graduation I got a job and have been working for 10 years. Couldn’t quit and can’t quit unless I struck a jackpot. This job requires more time and energy than what I’m being paid for. My life is sustainable only if I get paid for that month. Most likely I would have to work until the day I die.

"I’m trying to truly accept that nothing matters. Right now it feels like someone is holding my head underwater. I thrash and struggle, and that may make a few tiny waves, but it makes no difference to the larger body. Much like the universe looks at our individual pain and struggle. Even if I were to recover, make something of myself and live a good life, it wouldn’t matter. Any paltry legacy I might leave will eventually be forgotten. One day (if humanity hasn’t left the planet yet, or even survives) our sun will die and our little experiment will be over. 

I wish I still believed in God, or at least that there was a higher power or something greater guiding us. But we’re alone. There’s no preordained reason for my struggle, or anyone else’s. There is no “heavenly reward” or Earthly destiny, or anything else we use to comfort when faced with the sheer absurdity of it all. My dad gave his life in service of a fake god that man created, and his suicide means nothing. I won’t ever see him again. My mom is probably joining him soon, and I won’t see her again either. I’m alone, I’m about to be even more alone, and it doesn’t matter. Because time moves forward and we don’t have a fucking say in it. 

Some people are able to move on from pure nihilism to absurdism. I guess that’s how they find the strength to continue to exist. I’m not sure I’m one of those people, but I’m trying so hard. I mean, we are the universe recognizing itself. That’s pretty incredible. I think that’s what keeps me from suicide sometimes. That, and the terror of not having a consciousness. As horrible as I may feel most of the time, at least I’m able to feel.   Of course, I wouldn’t ever know what not “being” feels like. It would already be over by then.

Of course, knowing that nothing matters means that I could pretty much do whatever I want. I wish that was freeing. All I want is to be okay with existing, and I’m afraid of the lengths I could go to to do that. Hard drugs don’t sound like a bad idea anymore, if it’ll make me feel okay even for a moment. But I know that’ll probably make things worse, if that’s possible. If I overdose though, at least my family wouldn’t have a deal with another suicide. Just a tragedy.",Depressed

And if I still feel this way a couple years down the line, I definitely won't be sticking around, so with that in mind I *should* be making a final effort to recover but... I just don't care about anything anymore. And if I'm not gonna put the effort in now, I might as well just give up now.

I've been dealing with depression for many years now and was diagnosed officially in 2018 after trying to cope with it myself.

"I broke up with my boyfriend a couple weeks ago. With him I experienced both intense happiness and connection and very difficult lows and chronic anxiety. Since the breakup I don’t feel anxious anymore, which is a relief, but now I just feel dull and depressed. 

Socializing seems so unappealing, especially since I harshly critique my ability to communicate with others (and everything else I do, really). I feel like I have very little to contribute to conversations and often respond inauthentically, inaccurately, incomprehensibly, unintelligently, etc. Wishing I could be zestier and more interesting. Hoping I’ll fade back into the zestier person I’ve been at times. 

My sense of self is out of whack and I kind of feel like a blank slate right now. I often have a hard time figuring out what I want ro do in any given moment because I’m obsessed with what I “should” be doing and what admirable people would be doing. I do get pleasure from gardening and my newfound interest in backpacking. And dancing, sometimes. And cooking. And....eating! 

Food has been both a highlight and a struggle for me. I experience pleasure when I eat, but I often end up indulging in the pleasure until I’m too full. Or eating when I’m not really hungry in the first place.

Not quite sure how to move out of this gray cloud, but it’s felt good to just accept where I’m at and be a dull homebody for a bit.  Buddhist ideology has been helpful with the acceptance piece and not falling into negative thought spirals. I have little interest in journaling or processing the emotions I’ve been numb to. That might help? Or not. I don’t know...

I'm afraid to express my very honest feeling that I dread what the next couples months are gonna be like, and how stir crazy we're all gonna get, and what morale will be like. Something the health ""experts"" have no sense of, I know that from first-hand experience. 

A little over a decade ago I had an illness that required several surgeries and a three-month hospital stay to treat. And they just were perplexed that I'd get these bouts of depression and frustration. All I usually wanted was a little fresh air and maybe have something to eat that wasn't served to me on a fucking tray. They'd give their very official-sounding reasons on why they had these policies in place, but excuses didn't improve my mood. I still have nightmares from time to time about being back there. 

I don't know if this just an American thing, but anyone who doesn't slap on a happy face and remain positive-- or god forbid express DISPLEASURE-- during a crisis, oh, you're just treated as the worst piece of shit in the world! How selfish you're being, to dare think of what YOU'RE gonna do for the next couple months to keep your sanity intact when people are getting SICK out there and DYING!

"I think this is the closest I’ve felt to suicide, and it doesn’t feel the way I’d expect

Like probably a lot of people I’ve thought passively about suicide at various parts of my life, sometimes fairly obsessively when things were tough. I’ve thought about how I might do it and about wanting things to be over. But while I might not have always recognized it at the times, I don’t think I was ever anywhere remotely close to going through with it.

This feels different. Just matter of fact, like it might be the best, or only option; but also scary, like I don’t want to let myself think about it too much lest it become a concrete, easily doable option. 

I’ve been self-quarantining for the past 5 days due to possible covid-19 exposure. I desperately miss basic human touch and closeness and don’t feel things are going to be that much better when the quarantine period is over: we’ll all still be social distancing, and possibly under shelter in place or martial law. Whenever I think of literally a week ago, when I still was able to hug friends and hold hands and share food and just be less than 6 feet away from someone, I start crying. I miss it so much and I don’t know if I can deal with possibly up to 18 months of this. There’s also financial/job/future uncertainty, and anxiety about my parents’ health, that I won’t go into here.

I have a cat and have been doing tons of FaceTime and chat with friends, and they’re all wonderful, but none of it feels like enough. I just want to be able to hold someone and be held and to feel like this isn’t going to be forever.

When I was crying about it tonight, all I could think about was how hopeless it all feels and how much I want it to end, and how I would need to take care of the mess that is my room because I wouldn’t want whoever found me to see that. And then feeling relieved that I don’t have an easy means to do it at home because if I did I think it might be hard to resist. Even now I feel scared and like I’m trying to avoid thinking about possible means because I don’t want to go there because it might be too tempting.

I don’t know how to explain it but this feels so different from any suicidal thoughts I’ve had in the past and much scarier. I would appreciate any thoughts or just kind words.",Depressed

"Anyone else feeling guilty for worrying about their mental health during this pandemic?

I’ve been self-quarantined for the past week and it’s starting to really get to me. For the past few days I’ve been intermittently crying and occasionally having some kind of scary suicidal thoughts. I’m trying to use all the coping strategies I know (talking to friends, talking to professionals, being with my cat, mindfulness, distraction, etc) and while it helps it still feels really hard. And it’s hard to imagine something like this going on for months. 

I don’t really feel sure that I can keep doing this that long, at least not without being in a pretty bad and maybe not super safe place mentally.

But it also feels really selfish to worry about my personal mental health when we’re facing a public health crisis where so many lives are at stake.

""Why are you hiding stuff you bought? It's not like we care what you do with your money.""

AND YET, shit arises like, limiting kitchen access at night, or forcing me to have a curfew or showing displeasure that I bought something they don't like. 

They already think my depression is because I don't go out enough or I'm weak willed or I'm lazy or a mix of all three and when I do go out or try to have some social interaction, they get fucking snippy and sneer at me saying that I'm wasting my time when I should be working or be at home.

"God. Quarantine is really getting to me. I'm not usually that much of a sociable person anyway, but I'm always at least looking for opportunities to make friends and build new connections. Now it's basically impossible and my current status of any form of friendship is not being close enough to anyone to regularly talk online. I've only been talking to my brother and dad for the past month and tbh, I really miss going out to meet people even though I barely did it to begin with. 
I've really been treating myself like shit. Waking up at 2-3pm everyday and doing nothing except replaying old video games and watching crappy TV. I haven't been taking my meds and eating maybe 1 proper meal on a good day. I feel so fat and disgusting even though I haven't gained any weight and the fact that quarantine makes food harder to get just makes me feel even guiltier when I do eat. My mind right now is just constantly flicking between half urges to starve myself to death or jump from my window and feeling immensely guilty for even thinking of hurting my family like that. I had to drop out of school earlier this year and reapply to redo this year because the amount I had missed out on from being too comatose from depression/anxiety to go in made it impossible to catch up. I feel awful about being the person whos going to have to redo a school year, and even though I know it's got nothing to do with my intelligence, the fact that I couldn't hack it the first time around makes me feel like a joke. 
I hate this person I'm turning into. I mean to use the time I have between now and autumn to finally set up my art business, or learn a language, or earn some money, or *something* worthwhile, but so far I haven't done anything and I keep thinking even if I do I'll just fail because I'm incapable of being as successful as I want to be. I keep taking out my shitty emotions on whoever's close whenever I feel like I can't bear it anymore which is a really shitty thing to do and only really creates a positive feedback loop of feeling even worse about myself and doing even more destructive things. 

I spent all day today crying or trying not to (well, by all day, I mean the 4 hours since I woke up at 3) and eventually stormed out and spent about an hour in bed unable to move. I can't cry because I don't want to feel myself crying. I just want to dissolve. I feel bad about pretty much everything there is to feel guilty about and I just want to make myself suffer.

I can’t tell my family or friends anything as I feel they won’t understand or say things again like “ you have nothing to be depressed about” “ you are over reacting “ “ it’s just a thing in your head once in awhile”. I’m just tired of being told that my feelings are just a phase. I’m scared for my life and I have tried to attempt once and literally no one knows. I just don’t want to live anymore and as selfish as it sounds I just want people to understand me but not say shit I’ve been told over and over again .

"For the past month I've been feeling numb. As if I don't even have a personality, just a human being breathing in, breathing out, eating and sleeping. No motivation, no enjoyment from any activity. Would stay in bed from morning until midday because I had no interest in doing anything. Keep living like that felt impossible.

Today, I remembered I stopped drinking coffee some time ago, and I wondered if bringing back the morning coffee would get me out of my numbness, and help me reintegrate some lost sense of vitality. And to some extent, it did. I felt more connected to myself, more in sync, more alive.

However, I know that drinking coffee is just a partial aid with what I deal with in my life. I remembered I still had serious issues with my life during the time I regularly consumed coffee. So this morning I used the jump-start the coffee gave me, and looked into meditation and Zen Buddhism. Now, I've learned the concepts of Zen before, and I've practiced meditation from time to time (with not much success). But this time, I used a mantra to help me concentrate during meditation, to have less space for thoughts. And it did help me have less thoughts, and I felt I managed to be more present in the several meditation sessions I had today. 

And I thought to myself, this is life. Living in the present moment, progressing slowly, from second to second.

I think most of the mental suffering I've endured was caused by me prospecting too much about the future and pondering about my past, while neglecting the present moment.

I don't know what my future holds, but I'm willing to be committed to the present. Slowly progressing with it.

It's like everyone is saying ""I can't live for a few weeks in the state you lived for two decades"".

I really don't want to slip in any kind of gatekeeping bullshit. I just can't cope with this situation and how are others are dealing with it. Also how little they're able (and willing!) to understand, both in the past and in the future as well. Everyone acts surprised and baffled when you talk about suicidal thoughts; yeah try living in a state like this or worse your entire life. And it gets accumulative worse, ten years of being alone are worse than ten times one year. And this quarantine will have an _end_ eventually, there's an almost fixed end to all of this.

Im normally pretty upbeat and havent had any previous issues with mental health, but im really struggling at the moment

My mum and my gran are both elderly and vulnerable, so i get them their essential groceries once a week and leave them on their doorstep. I cant go in and have a cup of coffee, a chat and a hug.

"I have been feeling very worthless and inadequate for a long time and that's most likely due to the fact that I constantly compare myself to other often extremely high-achieving people, as well as the stress that comes from school.

Every time I feel this way however, I relive a moment that happened during October 3rd last year. I strongly believe that that moment was the greatest act I had ever done in my life, and by reliving it I'm telling myself that I did something that not everyone could have the strength to do, its something that distinguishes me and gives me worth.

But still, I feel as if I'm AJ from The Sopranos, complete with the high-achieving older sister and formerly abusive dad and dysfunctional family.

Also, my family, even my extended relatives, all really care a lot about school. I don't know why or how, but I once used to love learning and now I not only find it incredibly boring, I find it nigh-impossible to completely focus on school at all, whether in class or at home. Obviously, due to my environment, I constantly feel inferior to my relatives, and I believe they look down on me and view me as some sort of animal or beast or savage. Like I'm a moron and a sub-human piece of filth. They don't treat me like this at all, if anything, they seem to enjoy having me around, but I think it speaks a lot about my mental state that I think everyone looks down on me. Perhaps they look down on me the same way a person might look down on their dog. Adorable, but stupid.

I'm in my last year of school, and I know my family doesn't expect much from me. I can tell, and I hate them for it. At least most of the time. Other times I feel upset they would think about me that way, no matter how justified it may be.

I hate it when I see people, ESPECIALLY friends and family, accomplish their goals. I hate them and I almost had a panic attack when my cousin became an honour student. I know it's not his fault for working hard, but a part of me feels like I'm entitled to the same respect he gets, even though he works much, much harder than me.

Now, I'm far, far from being suicidal. I don't really have a lot of suicidal thoughts. But I have so many violent impulses every day. I want to bash the faces of everyone who is 'better' than me and anyone who underestimates me. I have to consciously tell myself that it's not their fault that they are hard-working and diligent. I struggle with other impulse control issues and I am completely inattentive, particularly in regards to schoolwork and I am too lazy to put effort into anything. I think I'm a very violent, lazy and entitled person. Laziness is such an underrated vice. You know what to do to make yourself a better person and also feel like a better person, but you don't feel like acting on it in any way at all. You let yourself wither away, completely complacent with being at the bottom of the world.",Depressed

"I’ve struggled with depression for half of my life since the age of 12 (mid 20s now) 
There have been bad, bad times, and sort of bad times. But never good times. I don’t know who I am without this disease and it hurts to know I may never know. 

I’ve been in and out of therapy for since I was a teenager and although it does help and has saved my life I feel like it’s just a expensive way to keep me alive. I have to pay someone to listen to all my problems and all my flawed thinking and they give me coping strategies and listen and make me feel understood. But ultimately I leave knowing that I will never be cured and all my hard work will at most make me feel  okay and not neurotypical or “normal.” 

I would say the last few years it’s gotten better but it’s only because I am busting my ass trying to do all the things my therapists suggests and actually trying to work on myself and fix the parts that are my fault. I am exhausted. And it’s mostly in vain as I barely feel any better. Maybe I don’t think of hurting or killing myself all the time. But I still feel hopeless, useless, like no one cares, and like it would be better if I wasn’t around. 

I started trying to take care of myself more and be a better person. I was a pretty negative person in my younger years and was a compulsive liar and manipulative because I felt like I had to use these schemes in order to get people to like me and stay. Also I hate myself so lying and putting up a facade is just so addicting. It was easier to live in a fake world with my ideal self even if it was lies than address my true self which I found to be horrible.

I stopped lying and stopped being a manipulative person as much as I could. It helped my relationships with my family and friends. I actually even made friends. I somehow got married and have a great partner. But I don’t feel comfortable talking to my friends about my issues and feel alienated from them as they don’t really know what I’m going through. Even when friends open up, I use humor to hide my own feelings or focus on them. I find it impossible to truly open up to people unless it’s been years and even then I fear they will be repulsed by who I am. I find it hard to talk to my partner. They know about my past and my mental illness and all my trauma. They have seen my breakdowns and my worst moments. But I’m sick of the “it gets better” platitudes and the “I’m here for you” BS. It’s tiring. And it doesn’t help. So I save it all for my therapist. 

But I am now finding it hard to open up to my therapist even. I find myself regressing and closing up even more. I’m ashamed of my “relapse” (read as: failing to do my therapy work like coping strategies, not taking care of myself, using weed to escape, etc). I’m scared to tell the truth of how I feel because I don’t want to be medicated against my will. I already take medication for other health conditions. And I just don’t want to do it. And I don’t want to be taken in for a psych evaluation or anything like that.

I just feel extremely alone and like no one truly deeply cares. Maybe my partner. But I can’t even accept their love because it seems fake or not real because I can’t believe them as I see myself as an unloveable hopeless creature. 

I want to be free of this disease so badly. I just wish every day that I was neurotypical.

That I could wake up not tired. That my body didn’t ache. That my mind didn’t always go negative. That I loved myself. That I liked the way I look. That I could enjoy life and not feel like I’m wasting it. That I could remember things. That I didn’t go days crying and lying in bed feeling empty. That I didn’t have to spend hours of my life and thousands of dollars to just talk to someone about how pathetic I am. That I didn’t have anxiety around people and could be really open with friends. That I could be free and live a life worth living.  I wish so much. And it will probably never happen. I turned 25 last year and it felt like a grave reminder that I have wasted half a century wishing I was dead. What sort of life is that.",Depressed

I guess this is the crux: *I thought I would have a career nailed down and be married with kids at this point, but I've wasted a decade hiding in a University because I'm terrified I won't live up to my own expectations.*

The lockdown has disrupted many of my coping mechanisms. I'm absolutely obsessed with losing the few things that make me feel happy/secure and I'm becoming increasingly paranoid. At the same time, my fears are self-fulfilling as I'm struggling to fulfill my obligations in order to maintain what I've got. I'm drinking far too much. Not every day, but I can't stop when I start. I keep waking up fully clothed on the couch with the TV still on. 

I also feel immensely guilty because I'm struggling when others are definitely in a worse position. 

Anyone in a similar boat?",Depressed
Ugh. Been inside most of the time cause of this whole coronavirus thing. Worse thing about it is it made me realize that I don’t wanna go back to my job and the daily grind. I hate my life and I hate myself. I just wanna push a button and disappear.,Depressed

"I’m new to this community, because I guess I never would have considered myself depressed before. I always struggle to determine whether my anxiety and depression symptoms were “really mental illness” or “just” me being “too afraid”, “too lazy”, etc.

"Just found this sub even though I’ve had reddit for years and depression for even longer. Moved to be back with family for the foreseeable future and my long distance relationship with my partner is making me feel worse than I have in several months. I love him and he’s great but he doesn’t really understand depression, and explaining to him constantly that I need a bit of extra love when I feel like this is tiring after awhile. We did long distance last summer too but we got to see each other monthly- I’m scared that without getting to physically be together for so long we’re going to fall apart. I get really sad at night and I don’t like it but I don’t know how to not be sad when I have no control over any of this craziness :/ 
It will be okay and I know that but in the moment it’s hard to be anything other than self deprecating and snippy. I feel bad and I am trying to not be so miserable but it’s hard sometimes. Thank you for being a safe space for me to share:)",Depressed

"I was doing a lot better until this pandemic came along. It's a unique disaster, because of its nature, all the ways I'd normally have to relieve stress and keep myself centered are unavailable. Normally when bad things are in the news, you can stay away from it, but this shit is in your face every second of every day. There's no OTHER news taking place, because all of life is on lockdown. 

And the news that comes is always BAD, either about how much more death has taken place, or that the quarantine measures about to be made even MORE stringent and be extended AGAIN. Or some asshole pundit they bring in to tell us how life is gonna fucking SUCK for the foreseeable future. And they don't KNOW that, they just need to bring on these hacks to speculate endlessly because you can't fill up a news cycle by admitting ""We still don't really know SHIT... tune back in tomorrow, but I'm not promising we'll know any more by then.""

About the only thing I've been able to do is just get as baked as I can so I get more easily distracted with shit. But that can only be taken so far. I'll get my mind onto something else and find some enjoyment in my day, but reality will eventually osmosis its way to me and my mood will tank.

That causes my mood to just swing back and forth so fast. And I \*KNOW\* I'm not alone in this, but you can't tell that by talking to people, because every fucker out there is slapping on the bravest, happiest face they can because that's what they've been conditioned to always do. Which is GREAT for people like me, we get to spend our whole lives being made to think there's something wrong with us for not being unflappable optimists all the damn time.",Depressed

The love of my life left me 3 months ago, she has already moved on and ghosted me. The betrayal and pain I feel is way too much for me right now.

I am burnt out at my job as a therapist while feeling consistently depressed and suicidal myself. Yet I need it to make money or I need to go home to my parents which is worse than being alone. I am so fucking confused about where I want to take my life career wise and this is really stopping and forward momentum regarding career. Unfortunately this is contributing to being very confused in life and causing a lot of depression.

 Alone every day, and struggling with chronic, severe, GI issues caused by a hiatal hernia I gave myself trying to workout and better myself. Unable to workout anymore which was the only thing helping.

I was doing so well over the past few years and the last 5-6 moths or so, I just haven't been able to gain traction. I slowly started to slip, and lost almost everything. I am struggling so badly right now.

I feel like I am starting to become a burden to the people around me. I can slowly see relationships changing because I am always not doing well, I am becoming that negative energy, and its killing me.

They say ""don't stay alone, talk to others!"" but besides there not being anyone (besides my family who is often abusive) there just aren't any words. I'm literally acting like a homeless person. It's way worse than others could imagine. I got an illness where I'm super embarrassed of stuff and I _also_ got plenty to be embarrassed of on top of it. Perfect combination.

I'm very emotionally exhausted from this friendship, so I'm kinda relieved. I feel guilty saying that, but it's true. I can't handle the constant ups and downs that she experiences without my own mental health suffering. She needs professional help, and she refuses to get any.

We both love each other, but I exploded two days ago from the constant stress. I didn't want to express to her how it was affecting me, but I did. She told me to make a decision whether or not to stay around, and initially I said I would stay around. I said that twice, but she did not accept the choice I made.

"It’s been years since I last cut myself or tried any suicidal attempts. Recently all I can think about is doing it all over again. I use to say I would never make it to my 20s, I’m now 23 and really wish I kept that promise to myself. Cause every year life is just getting worse. Anytime I try to talk about my emotions I Faust get told I shouldn’t feel that way. So I’m just being over emotional. Or I’m like being a bitch cause I don’t wanna talk about the problems cause if I do I’ll just blow up and start having a panic attack. So I just sit there upset being labeled as the cunt I am. I just want to lay in a bath tub filled with my own blood. I will say at least there is this sub reddit where I can write this and not having anyone I know personally see it. I get yelled at if I post anything emotional on Twitter.",Depressed

I have been hanging out and talking with a girl from work lately. She is cool. She reaches out to me and usually is the one to say “let’s get drinks.” The other day we were talking and realized we both had valentines weekend off. She said we should do something. I agreed but we never set anything up. So last night I texted her and I asked if she wanted to do something on Valentines Day. She said “I’ll have to see. Is that ok?”  I said “yeah for sure.” I just don’t know how to feel right now. I thought she would say yes by the way were talking. So I’m kind of bummed. I would have liked a yes.

"Everything is falling apart in my life the past year- schooling, career, my parents, family business, and my health. I stopped taking care of myself which progressed to worse health. I thought I knew what I wanted to do for my career, but I don’t. I finished undergrad with something I hate and now I can’t afford to take other classes as prerequisites for graduate school. I don’t have friends really (well a lot of them moved for school/work and they’re incredibly busy now) and I don’t have family other than my parents and shit, they hate each other and on the brink of divorce. My parents bring me into every fight and I have to calm them down and that’s at least 3-5 times a week. I do have a wonderful long term boyfriend though (almost 10 years!) Anyways, I finally started eating well, exercising, and losing weight. I was in the process of getting a new job. Really tried changing myself this year because I was so done being so empty and miserable. I think it’s called being “passively suicidal”- I don’t want to exist, but I don’t want to kill myself. The idea of something happening to me wasn’t terrifying and I know that’s not healthy. A month in to getting better and my boyfriend had an awful accident and had to get emergency surgery for his arm. He can’t take care of himself like before so I’ve been taking care of him as much as I can. I don’t mind that because I love him, but why. Why did it have to happen to him? (Not that I want it on anyone else but I can’t help myself to feel this way) He was trying so so so so hard to work his ass off and better himself too. We were gonna both save money so I could take my classes, but now he may be disabled for at least a year or forever. He was self employed so there’s no workers compensation and no one is responsible but himself. We are both uninsured and the emergency hospital bill plus the physical therapy bill is going to be absolutely insane. We’ve already spent so much money on just his prescriptions and his one doctor visit plus just the usual cost of living. The motivation for the gym and taking care of myself is now completely out the window. This was just a rant because again I don’t really have friends or family to talk to. I really realized this while he was in his 8 hour surgery and there was no one that I could talk to. I don’t want to talk to my boyfriend because he needs to focus on recovering and doesn’t need the extra stress....but guys, does it get better? Any advice? Anything?",Depressed
"Have you ever felt like you worked really hard to find the right job, take one and it ends up being a pile of shit?  Spent 10 months talking to hundreds of people, finally found a job last July after doing some independent consulting to fill in the gap. Found out that it wasn't what I was led to believe it was.

Since 2012, worked in tech industry, Job loss, over and over again, due to layoffs have absolutely ruined my work life. I've worked in tech for over 20 years.

Feel like I have to climb the mountain all over again. Feel like there is no way out of my present situation. Have to stick around this job for the family, but I'm 47 years old and don't see any other way out. I feel like I'm at the bottom of the barrel again, I'm just so tired of feeling this way. I am beating myself up over and over and over again about this. Wish I could go away, disappear, and start all over again.

I don't usually whine or complain but I am so absolutely depressed about this. I hate what my work life has become.

"February has been whack. It started off with me getting into a argument with my friend which caused me to dissociate for at least five hours straight. During said dissociation we put our disagreements aside and she told me I should get help but I refused. I was fine for a while and then it wasn’t but at the end of this depressive episode (I was hanging out with the same friend) I finally gave in and said I’d get help because during that time I realized my whole life I have been convincing myself I’m not suicidal because a large majority of the time I didn’t think about killing myself but was dying from other tragic incidents. However now that I’ve realized that I’m regularly having suicidal thoughts so that’s been a blast. 

When it comes to the getting help part my mom asked if I was sad today and for the first time in my entire life I instantly told her I was because well I want help now. Instead she asked me if I was talking to my “girls” (they’re my friends but that’s what parents do) and then said I shouldn’t be sad and should be glad.

Why the fuck do I do all this work to just cycle back to bullshit and have done nothing to show for it. What a waste of 9 years of work I have done to keep throwing it away again and again. On top of my 21 years of a waste of life...friends are pointless, future is bleak, mental state is trashed, physically I'm yoyoing from good to bad.

I'll always say I'm okay because I don't want to be a burden. The further I go, the more it feels like I am and I cant die in case I fail and become an ever more of a burden. My suffering and hatred makes it so others dont need to care...but it wears me out...",Depressed

"I'm just lost. I finished school last year and I decided that I will go for art, my passion, but I don't have money to go to art school so I'm studying by myself, and that's one of the reasons I'm lost. I'm lost because I'm finally isolated. I've wanting to be isolated from everyone for years, and know that I've done it, I don't know what to do. 
It didn't started this year, I've been slowing cutting a lot of people from my life, social medias, places, activities and etc for years, and with the ending of school I accomplished it. I no longer go out of my house, only rarely with my parents. I don't work, just help my mom with some stuff she does. I try to study, but sometimes I lack of confidence that I'll do it in the end. I don't see my last friends of school because they all moved to other cities. What am I doing?? The sad is that even if I want to change my isolation, I can't because the only way I could be with people is meeting new ones in other places (I live in a very small town), and I have no money or courage to go out. I can only see myself being happy again socially when I be very good at art, have a job with it and have money to go out of this city. 
If I decide to work now with other things, my dream will be put for later, and maybe never; I'm too awkward to be able to talk to someone new online; I don't have money to go to other places and neither have the courage to ask/say my mom I'm going out.

"posting here to avoid making a standalone post about a personal victory and making others feel bad.  I've posted in this sub a bunch of times, sometimes with throwaway accounts.  I love the resource that is this subreddit or admitting to things that I know are in a way public, because others can read them, but also anonymous and essentially risk-free.  

Well, I went to a support group earlier today.  It's a fairly simple 2-hour group with about a dozen folks usually.  we do introductions, make some announcements, then break into smaller groups to talk in detail about ourselves, then come back together as a group and discuss more topics before sharing positive news and ending the session.  The support group is immensely useful for me.  I feel like it supplies exactly what I need.  And today there were two new people at the meeting I had not seen before.  I haven't been going long enough to know for certain that anyone I haven't seen before hasn't attended before, but it turns out this was the case.  Both of these people were attending for the first time, and it was pretty clear that both of them were attending at a particularly trying time.  They rated their mood very, very low.  one was choked up and sobbing anytime they spoke.  it honestly broke my heart seeing folks struggle so much immediately in front of me.  usually meeting are fairly reserved and although we openly and honestly discuss our depression, it's not usually an expressive mood, so I just felt extra charged having that emotion so bare in the room. 

anyways, I ended up talking with both of these new people over the course of the meeting and I was just so appreciative of their ability to show up, share things about their lives, and contribute to discussions with strangers they had just met.  My initial reaction was one of wanting to put my hand on their shoulder and try to comfort them. Of course, I had to remind myself after all these years of reminding myself that platitudes don't solve anything.  and so instead I just stuck to the format of the meeting, listened as best I could, asked questions, empathized, and thanked them for showing up and sharing as is tradition.  

anyways, it just felt momentous i guess.  as I wrote, going to these meetings is already important to me.  I hate when I can't make one.  And then to see new people is interesting, because it's such a profound medium to be introduced to new people.  and because these new people were facing such intense struggle, and really being vulnerable showing that in public.  I guess on top of just being a great meeting, it was kind of significant because so recently I was the first-timer and now I got to help introduce some first-timers to what I've become accustomed to. 

During the entire meeting, I kept thinking about how much compassion and empathy I feel for other people.  I can't brag about it, it's out of my control.  It was so hard for me to sit in the presence of someone crying and focus on anything else.  and i've been that way literally since I was born.  anytime one of my siblings was upset/crying, it immediately distressed me, and I would get even more upset when I saw adults just ignoring a sibling crying.  It made me think during the meeting about 2 things: 1) just how absurd it is that we're able to go about living our lives and enjoying the things we're fortunate to have while people around us are suffering, dying in pain, starving, etc.  The notion that anything could be more important or gripping than the intense grief and misery that fellow people are undergoing, I just don't understand.  And the second thing, where is this compassion for myself?  I have none.  I am never good enough.  I am never working hard enough.  I am not worth the life I am afforded.  I measure myself against all the people I come across every day and meticulously note everything I am worse at.  Unhealthy competition with others; it ruins social interaction.  Dearth of self-worth or self-esteem, great ingredient for depression.  Comes from a high-pressure upbringing, but I can't kick it.  And somehow at the same time I care deeply about other people, even if I don't know them.  I mean, damn, that's kinda good but I wish I got some of the sympathy too.",Depressed

I’m trying to put myself out there and check out clubs and things and I’ll even eat lunch in the cafeteria alone which gives me crazy anxiety but idk I guess I’m hoping for someone to notice my consistent loneliness but that’s just hopeless and it’s all feeling hopeless and I don’t want to die but I don’t want to be living like this and I wish I could fast-forward through the rest of college because I feel so happy when I’m with my boyfriend and our friends and I’m rambling now and this probably stopped being coherent a while ago but yeah,Depressed
"I just don't know anymore, nothing makes sense anymore, nothing has any meaning, everything I found comfort in is either pointless or irritates me. I genuinely cannot see a future anymore.  


My job is killing me because they expect me to work at above peak performance despite knowing how badly I'm struggling and how much strain that places on me, my girlfriend frequently is irritated at me because I can't just turn it off, my parents don't understand what I have to be depressed about, my doctor just threw pills at me that aren't working, my friends are too busy to hang out with. I haven't showered in weeks, I can barely bring myself to do anything other than staring at a wall.

"I am new to this site and I don’t entirely know what I’m doing. I needed somewhere to go to express myself without expectations. My depression has come back full force. I spend most of my day pretending I’ve got it together and when I am alone it all crashes. I avoid people and avoid conversation because I have this fear someone might ask me to “hang out” and I can’t commit. I am so afraid because I feel like I can’t say “no. I’m sick. I’m not well and I can’t muster up energy.” I am sick. I’m not in treatment. I should be but that’s more energy I would need to find. I literally spend my day helping others in need. I have no motivation to help myself. I cry a lot. I feel lonely in company and at peace when I’m alone. I’m not doing well. Anyway, thank you for letting me share. This feels like a place I can reach out without fearing a commitment to do something I’m unable to do.",Depressed
"I’m beginning to come to grips with the fact that maybe I’m depressed. I’ve been basically letting my life fall apart for the last several months. Checking email, paying rent, and doing other basic things feel really hard. It’s honestly a surprise I haven’t been fired, evicted, and/or kicked out of school yet. For months I’ve felt like I just need to force myself to get my shit together and that my inability to do so is just a reflection of my general lack of will-power/self-discipline.

An additional thing I’m struggling with now is that while I think some of this began earlier, it really intensified sometime around last September, which is also when I had an experience involving sexual assault. It makes me wonder if that is part of why, but then I immediately start berating myself and telling myself I’m probably just using that as an excuse. It’s also possible it’s more related to starting a stressful year in my PhD program. I guess it’s also possible that both factors contributed. I dunno really why, but somehow it feels important but also kinda impossible to know why.",Depressed

I am told that they do this often at Middle East Airlines. Most dogs in that country meet a sad fate, being homeless, neglected, and abused. We wanted to get our yellow lab, named Tiger, out of a horrible situation and into a stable, happy home. 

I feel the spiral already. Like my mood is going to plummet, and down the drain I go. I am working hard on making this not happen. I've been pretty content for the past several months, but I have MDD and Dysthymia, and sometimes I get pulled under by the waves.",Depressed

But inside, every morning, I can't shake this horrible empty feeling of going nowhere fast, and complete monotonous pointlessness. I am constantly stresses about everything, working a meaningless job to barely get by, feeling like I wasted the last decade to a severe drug addiction and now, almost 2 years clean, still feel worthless. I go through motions everyday but it's getting harder every day. I feel like there's no one I can express any of this to, so I just sit in silence too much. I'm hoping that just writing things out can give some sense of relief. I know I'm loved and valued in my little circles, and people would want to help, but I want so badly to keep this image of being strong and stable that I'm terrified to worry anyone that I'm slipping. My urges to use have come back, the anxiety of daily life is back. I try to clean house, drive around, or get in the sunlight when i can. Some days it helps. I landscape, so when I have a long sunny physical day I feel invigorated after, but the next morning the gloom and dread is back. It's getting hard making the decision to put my mask on again every day. My girlfriend doesn't realize how hard it's getting, her brother committed suicide two years ago and I can't have her worry about me or think she's the problem. I am posting here and hoping this can maybe give me an avenue to share and get these feelings out and hopeful with others stories. I know I'm not alone in this, no one is. But it definitely is tough.

There are days where I feel like a failure because I’ve tied so much of my worth to my productivity, and lately I haven’t felt as productive.

Now a few days later I think I feel worse? All I know was that when I was trying to avoid acknowledging how poorly things were going, I at least wasn’t consciously thinking about it all the time.

My husband and I have not been actively “trying” but we weren’t doing anything to stop pregnancy. I have always wanted to be a mother and I have dreams all the time about being pregnant and having children. I was so excited and ran to the store to pick up more tests to confirm, they were all negative. It crushed me because I was so excited and was already planning ways to tell our parents etc since this baby would be the first grandchild for both sides. 
I have gotten the urge to cut again and I cry myself to sleep every night. It’s an internal fight because I was so emotionally attached to the “baby” for an hour before they were negative. Then I chastise myself for being so emotional because there was no baby so I technically didn’t lost a child.

And it drains me, too. I’m exhausted from my anger and left with no energy to do anything good for myself. I wish I could save that angry energy which it feels like I could break off my teeth. My heart clenching and my limbs vibrating with powerful urge to hit something - my chest, desk, a wall, my head, something, to release that stifling choking feeling of energy.

I wish I could do something to escape the environment that constantly makes me angry but that’s not possible. Then the reasonable thing to do is to manage that anger and use it for the good.

Since Friday afternoon I have not heard from her.

Having only 2 classes a week, one which only has 4 students doesn't help for me to able to meet new people. I've come to accept that I have no choice but to keep living the same cycle.

"I don't understand how people can be so happy. Can love who they are, and can wake up and look forward to the day. I feel like I'm drowning.

I get sad and over-eat, I get fat because I over-eat, I get sad because I'm getting fat, it's just one big vicious cycle that adds to it all. I find myself just having nobody any more. So many friends have just moved on and no longer talk to me any more and I don't know why. Did they get sick of me? Did they just find me annoying? I know that some old friends I fell out with have spread lies about me but I just don't want to get involved in drama so I just try and move on but it makes me feel so worthless.

I'm at the point of feeling like I just don't really matter at all. I have a ton of online friends who are great but when it comes to real life I'm just another cog in society. I go through shit and people know about it and it's like people just turn a blind eye to it. I've even had friends try and be there for me but they talk about me behind my back and I hear everything that they say, makes me feel like I can't even trust anyone.

My anti-depressants didn't work so I got rid of them, I went through a stint of making good life-changes, but when everything falls to shit and you're back at square one it's just demotivating.

I know nothing about the real world, how to interact with the people in it or how to pay bills or any kind of knowledge for getting through life. I feel extremely inadequately prepared for life on my own. I feel like I'd need some kind of case worker or assistant checking on me every couple of weeks.

"All to familiar with depression for about 10 yrs plus with it usually coming in waves. I’m a pretty silly guy if I’m comfortable but that rarely happens out of fear of rejection. For the longest time I always was frustrated and ashamed that I couldn’t overcome it through sheer willpower and avoidance of moments I felt I was slipping. Recently my counselor recommended some positive self talk(which I knew of but always felt stupid/embarrassed to do). It felt like empty wishing for something I didn’t truly believe in. During a recent session when he was asking why I felt my behavior was weird. I sat on that for the day and that night when I was going through one of my usual spirals the phrase “and that’s alright”

"Parents went to a lecture of a politician of a fringe political party who is also supposed to be a professor for physics. And he was talking about the ""radiation risks"" of wifi and 5g.

They returned in a mood like they were already dead - and _I_ killed them because the wifi is on because of me. In short, every mobile device is supposed to kill you, even wireless mouses. He of course is the only one who recognized this, he also had all the numbers showing how many people would get cancer yada yada yada. 

Parents dont allow any criticism against this. If I wanted to I should've come with them. ""Arguments"" in my family don't go well, I have no spine and avoid any conflict. We rather bury everything and act nicely, usually. 

My parents fetishize fear. They're afraid of the air, the water, the ground, the food. Ironically enough _I_ am the one with severe social anxiety. Hey you can spend all your day worrying about how much poison is in everything, you can absolutely do that if you don't have any other interests. And tomorrow a piano might fall on your head.

They are soo worried about potential cancer risks but don't give a fuck about mental health. _They_ are the ones making me ill and I'm too dysfunctional to move out.

"I've been in a massive flare-up the past two weeks. This morning, I had at panic attack at work. I went to the ER. I was scared as hell to tell the truth, but I did, I told them I was having suicidal ideation. I got stuck there for a good seven hours til a counselor could talk to me, but my husband waited with me through most of it, once they let him in the room til he had to pick the kids up from school. Before he came back there, I spoke to a nurse, and talked about how I've been feeling these past two weeks: trouble sleeping, exhausted even after a full night's sleep, listless, taking no pleasure in doing anything, thoughts that I just want to die. It was scary as hell to talk about, but not as scary as I'd been feeling for the past couple weeks. He asked, as did the doctor when she came in, if anything significant happened two weeks ago. I couldn't think of anything in particular, nothing major.

Then when we were alone in the room, I told my husband about my conversations with the doctor and nurse. I realized I forgot to mention I'd been away for two weeks in early February for a work-related thing. That was stressful, but not what caused the flare-up. Then I remembered what I don't even know how I forgot. Two weeks ago yesterday, I finally filed the report of an assault that happened over two and a half years ago, one that I'd been stuffing down for almost three years. I had a dream with my attacker in it the night before I was scheduled to meet the victim's advocate to do the report. I had another dream with my attacker starring in it a few days after. That was right before the flare-up started.

When I finally talked to the counselor, and explained all of the above (and then some, but I can't/won't share it all here), it just made so much sense. I have lots of stress every day. Just the regular stress of every day adult life with a husband, three kids ages 11-15, two jobs, closing on our first home in a month, the work trip while we were negotiating on the house, my oldest almost getting arrested for being an idiot trying to impress his friends... But the unboxing of my attack, telling my story and then trying to suppress it, was too much.

Just figuring out what triggered this flare-up took away such a burden. I was feeling like it came out of nowhere and that was scary as hell, thinking that I was just randomly in this dark place in my head. Thinking it came out of nowhere and could come again and I had no idea what signs to look out for, terrifying. Know really is half the battle lol. (I couldn't resist that lame ass ""joke"".)

I know my depression isn't cured, but I feel more hopeful than I have in a very long time. I was so scared to be honest about how I'm feeling, and now I'm so happy I was. And yes, I was referred to outpatient counseling and was given tons of resources, on which I will be following up.

The case is, that I don´t wanna tell her that I don´t feel loved because that´ll hurt her feelings and maybe I´m overthinking it, and I don´t want to fuck it up cuz I like her so fucking much.

"Today is my 25th Birthday 🎂 half of my years i spend in tears and alone. I didn't had any real friends. I never experienced real love. The last 7 years were hardest for me... Okay, i lie, the last 19, the day when i started going to school and got bullied for the next 8 years. 

Recently I've made two realisations: that i started to wanting to be dead from the age of 8! Another realisation was that i really wanna kill myself... And i think i am close on doing that. But i decided to give my life couple more chances. Anyone deserve second chance a.k.a. One millionth. 😊

The guy that i can't date because this Coronavirus got mad at me, and didn't wish me a happy b-day. I am extra sad because of this. 😢 I know that i sound like 15 years old girl.

That my own brain wants to kill me and I have to fight that almost every day. That I hate myself for things that I shouldn’t hate myself for. That I’m irrationally sad and angry and can’t put my finger on why. That sometimes out of nowhere I feel this indescribable emptiness, and I wish I could replace it with any feeling at all.

"This isn't /r/.relationships but I need to vent. It's really starting to hit me that I don't think my boyfriend's parents like me even though they haven't even met me yet. His parents have known we were friends for a while, but they were only just told recently that we're dating. They seemed hesitant of just us being friends at all which I understand because, on paper, I definitely don't seem ""good enough"" for my boyfriend, but since they've been told about us, I feel very judged and almost a little suffocated. My boyfriend's told me that they're very concerned ""I'll break his heart"" and that he's been advised to break up with me if he doesn't think we'll last so he won't waste any more time on a fruitless relationship. I understand that they're looking out for him, but I feel like they're not willing to give me a chance and are (hopefully unintentionally) setting the stage for me to be villianized if we ever were to break up. He's told me they're really curious about my schooling plans since I'm going to be transferring from a community college to a university at some point and they want to make sure I'll be independently successful and not just weigh him down and leech off of him. Again, understandable, but that just comes on a bit strong all things considered. It'd be one thing if they were curious about me as a person, but it just feels like they're trying to use that as a way to say he should find someone better and more accomplished than I am. Then earlier tonight, he told me how they don't like that I'm still working at my part time job in spite of the pandemic and in spite of the fact that I'm still dependent on my parents and don't technically need the money. I'd agree the store I work at shouldn't be considered essential, but it's just very strange to feel like I need to explain/justify my actions and situation to people who I can't even talk to directly and who I've never even see a picture of. 

This is my first relationship, and on top of that, I don't have a fantastic relationship with my own parents, so I have no idea how to respond to all this or know what I'll do when I finally do meet them. I've never felt distrusted and disliked like this before, and while I had a feeling they'd probably never like me very much, I didn't think it would be like this...",Depressed

I was oversensitive tonight, and now my current friends are annoyed with me.
I want to stop being burdensome for everyone I know, and the only solution I can come up with is death. But then someone would have to find my body and plan my funeral and inform everyone of my death, and instead of just being a burden on just the people I know, I become a burden to the poor RA who’d find my body all rotten and smelly, to the emergency responders who have to pick up my rotten, 300lb blob of flesh, to the police who would have to identify me and inform my parents, to the hearse driver who’d have to drive me two hours back to my hometown, and all the way up to the people who I didn’t know I would affect who would take time to come to my funeral and see my dead, deteriorated face if they chose open-casket.

I just don’t know if that would be worth it all to have my own form of inner peace. Then there’s a part of me who  just does not want to keep living this miserable life. Always disappointing people and myself to no end.

"Day 19 post breakup. One of my friends asked me how I was doing and I’m glad he’s been checking in every once in a while after everybody has probably gotten tired of hearing about my ex.

I joined a new discord server focused on productivity accountability and managed to push through on an assignment due tonight and that was great.

I mean I do but I have always hated the process. I’m anxious about it because there has always been some problem with me and being able to register and so by the time I’m able to do it, all the slots with the good teachers are filled. Also my narc dad gets scary whenever something with a lot of money is involved and he tends to ask me questions I can’t answer and if I can’t answer them he yells. This semester will also be the first semester I’ll be at school without him since he’s going out of state for grad school. Talking about this is really making me anxious and I just need someone to lean on and tell me it’ll be all good. This is definitely triggering some separation anxiety in me rn.

I feel depression creeping back in and it terrifies me. This is like a fucked up circle, I'm so afraid of my being unwell mentally that it makes me unwell. And on top of that, I think I'm in love with my close friend, who is going through first treatment for health anxiety disorder and we actually bonded around that topic  year ago and quickly became really close. I know it's not the time for my feeling or whatever, but I'm having trouble to control them. I used to focus on other stuff, but sitting at home alone 24/7 is not helping. I joked about maybe getting a roommate for a while before isolation is over, so I don't go totally out of my mind and the friend I mentioned said he might consider to come live with me and ""oh we can have fun"". He's definition of fun is probably just watching movies and here I am, just falling deep for him and unable to say anything.",Depressed

Find a anchor something that makes you happier it can be anything (legal) that just makes the mundane or constant self hatred less prominent in ones mind 


As well as when I realized (subjective to some cases) that when it came down to the end of the day the worst part of the day (for me like I said subjective) night were you sit alone in your room with no one aside from your thoughts for company I have to say that without a shadow of a doubt the best thing for me was to learn to forgive

When a teenager learns to forgive them they become adults


When a adult learns to forgive themselves they become wise

"I was diagnosed in 2013 with severe Anxiety and Depression, and PTSD from being brought up in a extremely abusive household. 

&#x200B;

The main point of this post is to address my lack of emotions and numbness that I have been feeling for the last few months. I have lost all enjoyment in my daily activities, and I find no enjoyment in new activities I have tried to learn just so I can feel something. Even at work, I'm just spaced out and going through the motions of life, yet nobody can seem to tell that I'm emotionally withdrawn.

&#x200B;

I moved across the country a couple of years ago, and I have really struggled to find new friends. I'm in college, I go to the gym, I play video games, I'm normally a social person..but I cannot for the life of me make friends. The reason I moved was to be in the place I wanted to be, and my girlfriend wanted to move closer to family, we have been together for 7 years, so I don't find it feasible to move back. The closest I got to having a friend group was with my girlfriend ex friend's boyfriend, and we really got along for about 6 months, he introduced me to his friend group and I thought that would be a start to making some friends, but like i mentioned above, my girlfriend decided that her friend was fake, and didn't want to be around her anymore, which translated to me being caught in the middle, and eventually my friendship with him faded away because his girlfriend instructed him to not associate himself with me, and I guess she gave the friend group an ultimatum to being friends with them or me, and they obviously chose them. This really hit me hard, because all of a sudden it felt like things were going to be normal again. 

&#x200B;

The only time I ever feel any sense of enjoyment now (or what makes me feel happy) is when I eat edibles, and it starts to kick in. That's the only time I enjoy video games again, when I have the energy to go outside and exercise, when I feel like I have the energy to take care of my homework, or clean the house..I just feel so empty when I'm not high, and I feel like that could be a slippery slope to something worse. I have never had the thought to try anything else, I simply take edibles to relieve my anxiety, but I've been eating 3 instead of just 1 so I can feel happy again. This has only been for the last 2 or 3 weeks, but I don't want it to get out of hand.

I'm sure many of you have felt like this, if you have and you made it out of a similar rut, what did you do exactly to help yourself?

I cannot relate when I hear people talk about their fear of death or dreading death (either accident or natural). Death doesn't scare or worry me at all. In fact there is some sort of calm about it.

"I haven't taken a bath in like a month, and it's not like i feel i absolutely *can't* like I sometimes do, i just don't want to put the effort, i don't want to think about anything, i just want a long time out after i finished uni around 4-5 months ago, which i finished with a below average grade,  
I'm also highly suspecting i have adhd in some form, i should check that, but i neither have the money nor the energy to do it to be honest, but in all honestly I hope i do have it, then i can finally know what's wrong with me and it's not just ""i don't know"", I'd finally know why I've been depressed for I think around 10 years so far, even though i dont have a particularly hard life,  
Also its fucking surprising how people can't tell for shit how other people are feeling, i keep discovering and rediscovering this since i keep thinking things like ""no way is my family going to think im fine just because i had a slightly more life-y voice today or didn't greet them with a stoic face"" but here we are, i think this was called false consensus i can usually notice these kind of things, although that's probably just because I've had depression for a while and nothing else  
Yesterday i went to the r/adhd sub and read a thread in which the OP said their psychiatrist told them that something like ""every ADHD patient I've had always thought they're a bad person, that they're somehow innately bad"", that made me cry a bit, hopefully me thinking i have adhd isn't just escapism    
Also fuck my memory, i can barely remember shit, old or new, i forget practically everything, even things like muscle memory which is supposed to stick with you for a looong time, which ironically i forgot how i discovered, i think i was doing something which i did a lot before, but can't remember it at all   
I was going to write a second ""fuck ______"" something else but i also forgot what i was going to say lol  
I wish i could say i feel better after writing all this, but not really, I've noticed that my depression is more ""passive"", it's less about feeling bad and more about feeling nothing, I'm just ""passively"" depressed you could say   
Also a pigeon made a nest on my rooms window, I'm afraid a week or so from now i forget she's there and open the window, scaring her enough to leave her eggs, so i kept trying to scare her *before* she laid eggs, i shoo-ed her 3 times but she keeps coming back, probably because my window is half covered with an olive tree, so maybe she feels safe there, either way i hope i don't make a mistake and scare her away,   
What i did wrong was, when i shoo-ed them away, i kept throwing the half-nests she and her partner were making, i did that so they'd leave the place, i didn't think they'd keep on coming back, the problem now is i think she doesn't have time to build a nest anymore since she hasn't moved from the small half-nest she made this morning (it's night now), i want to help her, maybe get the nests i kept throwing and put them close to her, but this is highly likely to end up a failure and she'll maybe leave her eggs, so im probably not doing that, i don't really know what to do, i hope the weather isn't too cold   
I haven't really proofread this, which i usually do to whatever i write since i can be very conscious, so it's probably gibberish-y, not like anyone is gonna read it anyway lol, this is more like a thinking to self diary I guess (do those exist? Idk)    
Last thing, taking a long off time after uni was a good choice, i *reeeaaally* needed the time off, thankfully i live in a country where living with your parents is the default instead of the ""find a job or be homeless, or go back to your parents house and feel like a failure, also maybe discover how much your parents reeeaally don't want you in the house"" kind of thing that i keep hearing reading about, really fucking weird attitude,   
Im thinking of taking a longer time off, not sure if i really **need** it vut i really don't want to put an effort yet, i just want to clear my mind a bit,   
This goes without saying, but i always keep forgetting, NO ONE feels what you feel, don't expect people to understand why ""im not searching for jobs yet"", they always say (while feeling offended/ticked off too) ""just send your CV, it's not much work, you're not gonna find a job instantly anyway"", except it is a lot of work for *me*, you're not even trying to look from my perspective,  
But i can't hold it against them since how should they imagine anxiety/depression/weak will when they don't know them, or maybe they do know them but can't imagine me having them since my life is probably objectively easier than anyone in my family, it still sucks shit though  
Also writing long text on phones isn't as bad as i thought it is, still bad though, God my hand hurts lol   
Goddamn this is long, i was just gonna write about me not being able to bath for like a month for some reason, or maybe i *did* plan to write more than just that, i can't really remember anymore,    
Also fuck mosquitos, i hate them so much",Depressed

"So I didn't drink myself comatose last night. Or yesterday at all, actually. Full disclosure, I haven't drank in five days, the longest dry spell in well over a year.

It was almost funny, the longing and desperation clawing at me as I forced myself to pour out the last of my rum, the urge to lap at the ground like a crazy person as the puddle vanished into the gravel. I don't know how long this will last, but it's the first time I've ever done that, and...shit, I don't know. It feels amazing, even through the tremors, the vomiting, the voice screaming at me when I wake up in the middle of the night drenched in cold sweat to get to the liquor store, ***now.***

I just wanted to share that here, because, I dunno, because I don't really have anyone else to share with, I guess. Maybe I can't do this alone. 

It hasn't been a cure. I get it's only been a few days, and I guess I shouldn't have hoped for a miracle, but yeah. No cure. It's all still drenched in a thick grey fog the desert sun will never be able to burn through. I still go about my day with a voice in the not so distant background urging me to just kill myself already.

Shit. I don't even know what I'm going on about, why I even bother with posting here, why I'm even trying to not drink. Why not? We're all gonna fucking die anyways. Plenty of great people have been forgotten, and I sure as hell ain't no great man to be misquoted on positivity posts.

But I guess I'll keep trying with this whole life thing. I don't really know why, but I'll try. That's all you can do, right? Here's to a cup of u/nomoreorangedrink's favourite tea, and much love to all of you. Never stop trying ❤️",Depressed
It’s finally sinking in. I have almost zero genuine friends now. Due to my hair loss at such an early age I never got out the house and hung out with friends cause I was too embarrassed.

This realization is killing me and only weed or alcohol can make me forget about it and be happy internally.,Depressed
"Perhaps I'm just adding to chorus of misery, but I'm trying to do things a little different this time with my depression. Im trying proactive communication and expression. It's been a long while since I've felt this level of hopelessness and lethargy. I've been surprisingly durable for about 2 and a half years now. Despite some really dark shit going on, i was never consumed. But I suppose the wall was meant to fall at some point. I guess being forced to reflect and feel really sets in a certain mindset. (Quarantine) sadly this reflection hasn't been useful or good. I've grown to avoid myself. So all it has been is a humdrum of feeling pathetic, worthless and useless mixed with TV/movie avoidance. Which then perpetuates the feelings more. I'm really trying to cut me some slack, but I'm tired of running from the void, monolith, whatever the hell it is that keeps me in a stasis. If you all have any tips on how to truly sit with yourself, I'd very much appreciate it.

Life is just terrible right now, and I really want to see my health improve again. I can’t afford a therapist anymore and I don’t think my medicine is making much of a difference anymore, so everything seems so awful.

I’ve been feeling worse and worse the past two years but ever since the beginning of this year it has been its worst. I hate myself. I’m sad all the time and I can’t control it. I get jealous too often which I know and it makes me act like a jerk which I hate. I always end up pushing people away and never talk about it. No one will ever care about me as much as I care about them. Especially during this time I have tried to reach out to friends to talk because I miss them but they never text me first. It’s like replying to me is a burden which hurts. I then stop texting to see if they will reach out which they never do so then we just stop talking and I feel like nobody misses me. I just want to FaceTime and have long conversations but people make up excuses and only reach out to me for homework. I often ask to do homework together and the person doesn’t respond so I send them the answers only for them to say they didn’t see it and did it already which I know probably isn’t true and that they just didn’t want to talk to me and did it with someone else.,Depressed

Also my college education now feels like a joke. Did bad on a recent exam in one of my formerly in-person courses and asked the instructor for help only for her to basically not give a shit. And they're saying online learning may continue through the fall? No thanks.

It's just fucking awful. The current situation, the deaths. And I also cannot imagine what it's like to be unemployed right now. Or to have lost your business. On the news basically every day ""X has shut their doors for good"" I mean... wow. I have been positive about this situation in real life for a long time, and have done my best to cope with it.

But the reality is, things are shit right now and it doesn't look like anything will get better any time soon. I'm not even mad that I can't do my normal routine, or go to non-essential places. I'm upset because my education is taking a hit. These instructors say they care, especially right now but they don't. I worked my ass off last semester to raise my GPA. I've been working hard this semester and I was doing great. Then this happened and I tried to adapt. I thought that was going decently. At least I tried. But the second you slip up you are shit out of luck. I'm so tired. And nobody cares. I just feel so done.",Depressed
"I am not doing well. Things just get worse, to be honest. The anxiety and the depression, all of it, just gets worse.

This feedback loop of depression sapping any motivation and energy I have, in turn causing me to fall behind in class and with other responsibilities, which in turn makes me more depressed, is unbearable.

My life fell apart in the last few years and I dont think I've ever recovered. I dont even know how to anymore. Depression stole basically everything from me. I dont even feel like I have a personality sometimes now; depression is the personality. I have been depressed for a very long time, but fuck if it hasnt gotten unbearable.

Any happiness feels so fleeting. I miss having a relationship. I live with a couple and at times it just makes shit feel so much worse and lonely because of what I lost. It hurts more than I realized for a long while to constantly be around this and be reminded that for whatever reason, I havent found similar. Even though it may not be true, my mind immediately jumps to my own shortcomings and inadequacies, which drives me deeper into this hole.


I'm fucking tired. Shit would have been so much easier if I was more normal. And people just assume you are lazy or you dont put in effort. I'm not so lazy that I'd rather die than put in effort, it's just not that simple. 

At times, it feels like trying to explain depression to someone who hasn't experienced it is like trying to describe a color to a blind person. What do you tell them? Red looks like heat from the sun feels. Blue, like dipping your hand in cool water. Green, like an empty forest with wet air. An incomplete description. They will get the idea, but they can never really see the color. People can understand that you are sad but they dont understand that it is day in and day out. They dont understand the intensity, the lethargy, the anhedonia. They dont understand the insecurities, the hopelessness or the difficulty in dealing with something that can so effectively take a sledgehammer to every aspect of your life.

Wish I wasnt so afraid of death tbh.",Depressed

I decided I'd take some time to travel south east Asia. I absorbed so many sunk costs like breaking my lease, dipping into retirement and whatever else...I was able to travel through India for a good 2 months or so and did some volunteering along the way. I have mostly felt empty the entire time. Just chasing things to check off a list. Taking pictures to post to IG just to prove I'm alive. Parts of this travelling has been freeing but other parts of it has reminded how alone I am.

"The last trimester of 2019 was really hard for me. I felt really frustrated with many aspects of my life so I started feeling depressed again. Since day one of this year I started to change the situation, started working out seven days a week to control the urge to do drugs, started going to the therapist again, started having a routine, a real routine. I was eating better, sleeping better and feeling better. None of my issues were resolved but I was in a good path, me and my therapist were discussing that the cause of my depression could be ADHD, and that in fact a routine and new patterns of behaviour could help me a lot in the longterm. I was able to understand why drugs are a part of my life since very early and why I'm like this. I
liked that life.

"Thank Christ I’m on a long term antidepressant that seems to ‘work’ for me (Valdoxan). I’m currently unemployed and taking it really hard. All my self doubt is stemming from the fact I quit my high profile job to upskill and retrain in my field, but then everything fell apart pre covid. I couldn’t get a job in my normal field after this, and again now, my one super specialised skill is not doing me any favours in a covid world. I have no idea what else to do now that my Dream is crushed, and have zero other employable skills. It’s funny how ones self worth is tied so much to employment. The downward spiral continues.

"I've been feeling like a robot since years. I'm only a 20yo girl, why do I feel so empty and ""programmed"" since so many years? I feel like I don't have emotions, everything is just my brain trying to blend myself with other people.

People my age usually have hobbies, interests in life, goals... I don't have nothing. Everytime someone asks me what do I like to do I just don't know what to say and change the topic... I'm an empty person.


Why the only feelings I can feel are sadness and anger? Why can't I be happy?

But recently I fell in love, I was having good emotions, I was actually SO in love with him, I saw I can actually feel love for someone... But it was a total failure. It's like life doesn't want me to love and be loved.
I usually don't care about people, it's not their fault, it's been a long time since I've had interest in people or things in general, but the chemicals in my brain actually worked with that person, and that person is gone of my life now. I can only have 0 feelings or have too many, I'm unworthy.


I want therapy, I want to take meds, I want to cure myself from this depression. I'm tired of having suicidal thoughts every day. But I can't get therapy, I've already been rejected in my house for showing emotions. The only resource I have is myself and the abilityto just exist until I can get therapy myself, or end it all. And I'm really tired already.

"I'm fucking some with this fucking illness. I hate having to hate myself and feeling like everyone hates me. I'm 16 and my first ever girlfriend broke up with me 2 months ago just as I was at a really low point. I trusted her that she wanted to be with me. I let myself be deluded that anyone would ever fucking love me. I thought she did at the start but I guess as she got to know me and found out how pathetic and hopeless I was she lost interest. At the start I think she wanted to try and save me, to be the thing that pulled me out of the shadows, but in the end I wasn't worth any fucking effort.

I drove her away by being too stupid to realise what I had and by complaining that she may not feel the same way about me. Of course she didn't and I don't know why I ever believed her when she said she did, because she had to tell me over and over again that she did but in the end she was lying to both me and herself. She did nothing wrong and she deserves better than me anyway. I'm a piece of shit and ill die alone while good people like her can find the love they deserve. And I'm glad she could get away from me before I ruined her any more.

I thought I'd come to terms with that and the fact that if she didn't want to be with me then that's OK. I still believe that it's likely that was my only chance at a relationship and even though everyone tells me I have my whole life ahead of me and I'll have a second chance I don't think that's how it works. These years are when people have relationships and new experiences and I barely did that. I kissed her once and she only half kissed me back. After school it's gonna be all downhill. Right now I can take for granted my youth and the fact that I don't need a job but it won't be like that later. When school ends I'll have nowhere to go. I'll be stuck alone by myself like I already am except people won't be forced to be in a room with me so I won't even have the luxury of necessity for people to spend time with me. And it's really just dawning on me just how alone I'll be, especially now I have evidence of how hard it is to love me.

I'm turning 17 in a week and I bet not a single person will fucking remember. I'm no ones favourite person. No one texts me first unless they need help with homework or some shit. No one cares about me except my fucking mother. But I can't blame them. I hate me too. I bet not even anyone reading this will give the slightest fuck about what I'm going through and about all this pathetic whining.

For a while I kept thinking I'd be happy if I could just find a girlfriend, I mean, my roommates seem happy, so it must work, right?

Recently though, I've started thinking that isn't the case, and I need to find out what's wrong with me before I try finding someone else. Otherwise I'll just be putting my problems with self worth onto someone else's shoulders.

I broke down as my ex asked what cheese I wanted on my burger. He hugged me tight and kissed my head. It was a great release. But also empty because I haven’t had the courage to ask why he wanted to break up yet wants to spend time with me. After dinner we then headed to his room. Did the deed and I got dressed. He kissed me on the lips and we hugged again. I started crying again and said it was the holiday (partially). Sobbed the whole way home.

I hate myself for going to his place. For thinking he could actually be decent and want to be friends.

I considered making a post instead of just a comment, but my gut reaction to that is that it would be a waste of anyone and everyone’s time because I don’t have anything important to say, certainly nothing more unique than that I feel sad and I don’t know why.

For some reason, I feel like there should be one emotion a day. A sad day or a happy day, but that’s pretty unrealistic and ignores the tide and flow of daily events and coinciding feelings.

But lately I feel like I've heard that so much that it's bullshit. I know that I'm the only person who can help myself and it's so fucking hard. 

I feel like a failure because I'm so hard on myself; no job even after applying to multiple and still applying, never had a relationship, family struggles. I'm only 21 and I know that I have my whole life is ahead of me, but I'm tired of hurting. I just want something good to happen to me for once. I feel left behind. 

I cry myself to sleep more than I'd like to admit because I'm just full of nothing but dark thoughts. And I can't afford help, so I'm stuck in an endless loop of not knowing what to do to get my shit together and get out of it. 

I don't have any intentions on physically hurting myself because I do have goals to reach in the future, but I have the worse intrusive thoughts every now and then that scare me. 

I'm really trying to support myself and become a stronger person, but I feel too weak for the world at times.",Depressed

I’ve never dated and I was also never a good student in high schooI. I get I’m still young but I feel like I have nothing to offer the world.

"Saturday night I had an anxiety attack/depressive episode that started from thinking about financial stress, then school stress, then family stress, love stress, self worth, etc etc. I got drunk and mentally attacked myself for hours while telling my partner they shouldn’t and don’t have to stick around to deal with my shit and that when they decide to leave that I already understand why and that it’s ok because I am a lost cause and that people have only stuck around out of pity and that I don’t want their pity. I fathomed that any good thing I have is because of some odd chance and that I’m a joke and that nothing makes sense and that I’m a piece of shit and a burden and blah blah blah. Rereading my texts the next day made me cringe and made me feel even more sad for my own self. I laughed hysterically while I cried that night. I felt crazy.

This is not the first time an episode like this occurred. Especially while intoxicated.

I cried on the bus yesterday and wished so hard to become an inanimate object that I felt myself becoming my seat. Today was no better. I tried to explain my thought process to my partner and felt heard and better about the whole weekend fiasco. Then the thought that they’ll realize how crazy/damaged I am sooner or later and run for the hills, taking my secrets with them and only looking back thinking about what a bullet (I am) they dodged—and that maybe I shared too much realness with them—scared me to death and made me want to isolate myself from the entire world. I started shaming myself for voicing my dark thoughts and got mad that I thought I needed anyone else to help me but myself. For trusting anyone with the very things that eat at me. Again. And to know that they could easily leave whenever they would like to. Taking with them the little hope/love/energy I have left. I don’t need a single damn person, I thought. My abandonment issues shine bright at times like these. I sat in my room in a shaking panic as my mind continued to spiral. My partner texted me like normal and I felt even worse thinking of the current situation: me, losing my shit in my room for no goddamn reason while my partner decompressed from work and got high and scrolled through social media not knowing the horrible things I was thinking. My partner then FaceTimed me as per usual. I had trouble showing my face. I told them I thought I should probably get back on medication and started crying as I said it because after the last time, I told myself I’d never be on them again. I cried silently with the screen facing the ceiling. I told my partner I was ok and to go to sleep. I text-ranted my half sister and although she provided substance I did not feel understood and her stupid optimism annoyed me. I cried more. In fetal position.

30 minutes later I caught myself numbly scrolling through Instagram baking accounts. I realized I wasn’t crying. I thought of how dumb everything—including this past weekend, month, year, life—is and retorted that getting back on medication was silly and unnecessary and that I’m completely fine. This is a vicious cycle for me. I don’t know how to handle it anymore. My lows are so fucking low I just feel like I get more and more irrational each time and the thought of killing myself just lies over my head taunting me. I’ve been in lower states I suppose, so I just get scared thinking that any second now I’ll be writing a suicide note again. As if I don’t have control over that. If that makes any sense. What even makes sense? I dunno anymore... 

TLDR: I am unstable and life is a fucking drag.",Depressed

"Tired. Stressed. Classes just started (I'm in college). Don't have much hope for the future. Lonely. Lonely. Lonely.

Questioning the purpose of life in my head. Questioning if my depression is valid. Questioning who I really am. Questioning whether or not I want to continue being in college.

Wondering if I'll ever amount to something. Wondering why life is so hard for me. Wondering how I ended up like this, and who is to blame. Wondering if I'll ever find true love and happiness.

Trying to organize the mess of thoughts I have in my head, trying to see if I can piece together the reason why I am depressed, to no avail.

And the worst thing is that the more I pry into myself, the more I close myself off. It's making me crazy. It's me subconsciously working against myself.

And with that, it's making me doubt my depression even more. Am I really depressed, or am I just lazy and spoiled? Or am I just an entitled piece of shit?

And worst of all, am I subconsciously faking this depression for some sort of reason I don't even know?

And are my chronic medical issues (which my doctors haven't been able to find their cause) that are contributing to my depression also being faked by my mind working against me?

----

On a separate note, escapism has been working quite well for me, enough so that I have distanced myself for my depression. I've distanced myself from life as well, however.

My depression is still there. I think. I don't even know for sure because I've pushed most of its glaring symptoms so far back. It's probably just quarantined for now.

I feel less stressed than I used to before, though, even if it's only by a little bit. 

But I'm scared. Why?

Because I fear that when the moment I have to face reality arrives, it'll all just come spilling back out.

The recent political news (I live in the US), virus outbreak, problems with global warming, and etc are getting to me more and more.  I find myself thinking whats the point?  

But, I am trying to keep positive so here are some things I'm reflecting on:

\- My wife and kids are awesome.  I love them dearly and making sure I'm doing all I can for them helps give me focus.

\-I've been going to the gym 5 days a week and I feel healthier and less ashamed of my body.  I struggle with body image issues and I feel like that is getting better and I'm proud of my commitment

\-I'm trying to get more sleep...I hope this helps since sleep has been iffy dealing with the new born

And speaking of which, happiness to me is having someone with me to listen to music with. I drive along and am listening to something heavy and epic and I start to picture someone next to me, smiling and rocking out to the song as much as me, getting lost in the music and reveling in how awesome it sounds. Of course it all somehow revolves around me just wanting to share something I'm excited about with someone... even if they don't particularly care for it, humoring me would be good enough. ""This song is so awesome! You HAVE to check it out."" But of course, there's never anyone there.  Just me and my thoughts.

I cut people off since I sometimes know their limits better than they do and I usually try to be sober by the end of the night to either see people off or drive stragglers home or let them stay over.

Not a boyfriend or girlfriend. Not someone's best friend. I wonder how often people really think about me at all.

Now I am coming to realize that its my baseline habit of thinking. I find myself ruminating endlessly about things my wife does until eventually it becomes screeds of negative thinking about finances and my job outlook. One in particular is the thought that law school was a waste and I am stuck at my current job, even though I've had several interviews since then.

Been through some tough tough times and haven't had time to really process much or even accept what I've been through. It's still there though. It's hard not to think about it 24/7. I'm very insecure about it. What if I can't process everything, ya know? Do people go through different types of depression?

Realized over the weekend that my mom is living in a state of shambles, the whole family dynamic is fucked up and while I feel very awful for the situation, the stress of figuring out how to address the issues with my mom is something that I cannot handle. 

I’ve been feeling for weeks like I need to see a therapist and psychiatrist because I’m done, I go between feeling so sad to so defeated which is a nice change from feeling nothing for so long but I’m always questioning why I bother.

You know what hurts the most? I love you. I've only wanted to protect you from the start. It hurts so much that you stabbed me in the back and my therapist tells me that I should let go of you.

"I just made this account because I wanted to post on this sub and not be judged by account peepers of my other account. I'm posting this on this sub because I don't have anyone to talk to. I'm just going to post my experiences with depression in my life.

About 10 years ago, in the middle of high school, my mother(only parent) got sick and I didn't know what to do, how to handle it, my older relatives basically let her sickness be an abstraction of my life so I can focus on school. I was just a scared child, going through the beginning of a heavy workload in academics, having to think of my next steps in life, and with my mother sick.

I didn't exactly cope healthily. Won't get into that too much but it's also not serious, or very relevant, I just let the thought of her dying carry over to my everyday life and my bad mood had made me push friends away from my life. At the time I thought they wouldn't be able to understand. 

Ever since, I've been doing much better. I'm so grateful to be breathing air. I remember the years after my first counseling session just before graduating HS, everyday was like taking a half step up the stairs, but I was moving up. Suicidal thoughts are nonexistent, I'm proud of myself, what I've done and my ideals. I feel like I've come out of a 8 round boxing match as a victor of that period I first felt depression. Yet still, I feel like a boxer who will never retire, or one who continues to come out of it to fight just one last match....

I'm currently studying abroad out of my own will, convincing myself that if I muster on I will have a life of relaxation and happiness waiting for me after my masters/doctorate... Everyday feels like hell. Everyday. There's no reason for my depression now, really, I miss home and I always feel better coming back but even there I don't need a reason to feel depressed. 

It's only been 9 years, so maybe one day I'll get used to it. To those who are not depressed or suffering with anxiety who are just lurking, this isn't something I could ever control. I do smile, I do laugh, I do find ways to make me happy on my own and have experience defaulting to those things that do, but those moments are insignificant to me. Sometimes, even in those moments, I'm depressed with a mask on...still the best cliche to describe how I feel everyday.",Depressed

I keep trying to get outside of the house so it feels like im at least accomplishing something but it just feels so fucking lonely each day cause I do it alone and I have no one to be with. I just can't help but thinking bad thoughts and I end up just feeling sick and then laying bed all day cause of it. I just feel like I want out of this or at least someone to talk with and hang out with.

In my depression, I just want reassurance that I’m loved and cared about. But I fear he’ll shut me out if I ask him to share with me his concerns.

I am dealing with a breakup, having an empty birthday where I didnt even get so much as a happy birthday, not even from my own mom. It's around the anniversary of my grandfather's passing, one of the only people I ever had that made me happy and cared about me.

There's this rage about the situation brewing inside me, and it has nowhere to go except into fueling the depression into something so unpleasant and explosive I don't know how to describe it. If I weren't such a hypochondriac and afraid of hospitals, I'd probably really hurt myself.

All of this has taken so much energy that now I could get into trouble with work, and I have to scramble to prevent it..while having no energy, while feeling burned out, while hating myself.

I've been doing writing, painting, and chores that I'd been putting off for a long time. However, I cried in the grocery store today because of a mildly embarrassing incident. I guess being able to cry is better than being emotionally numb, but my reaction to the incident still felt disproportionate. I was crying a lot, like ugly crying in my car a lot before I could go home. I felt horrible. Most of the time I've felt good though. The Wellbutrin makes it easier for me to feel good feelings too, at least. And to be productive. I just wish I was tougher or had a thicker skin or did whatever it is people who say they don't let ""it"" bother them/get to them do. I don't know how to magically ""not let it get to me"".

Meds have not seemed to make a difference whatsoever.

In this past year I've started to think that I am actually starting to go insane from it. It's harder than ever before, I can't connect to others, I have lost every ounce of motivation left in me.

"Two weeks ago I drove to another city to meet someone I know. The whole thing did take two days and cost a lot of energy. A theater was selling their old costumes and I thought this could be 'fun' visiting it with someone else. I'm having severe problems doing anything meaningful with my free time, there's also a lot of stuff I simply can't do. The other person is my only social contact outside of family and I only see her a few times per year. For me 'this' is also ""practizing being an actual functionable person"", something I've been doing for years now. Trying to be an interesting person, improving social skills, etc. Neither her nor my family knows that I'm ill. I can spend the whole day with her without any problems but the next day I might not be able to open a door at university and go in. Being with her also gives me a break of a few hours where I'm not constantly screaming inside.

The theater was a nice distraction. There were hundreds of people who entered in groups. We spent hours looking through the clothes. Managed to somewhat deal with my impulsiveness, selfdoubts, feelings of being worthless and problems buying something. Bought a unique type of coat for 40 bucks in the end. We spent a few more hours in the city afterwards. 

Yesterday I hung up the coat in my room to get rid of the pleats and a bit of the smell. That was a mistake. Ofc mom discovered it, demanded to know what it was and saying it's trash. I already knew this would be the only possible reaction the moment I bought it. I got no privacy and neither does anything I own. Theoretically I'd have to put padlocks on every single drawer. Nothing I safe. Constantly hiding everything unless you want to be criticized and feel bad over every single thing. 

I already started not giving anything about the opinion of my parents a long time ago, I was way worse in the past where I automatically felt super guilty all the time and only acted in anticipatory obedience. All of this crap did and still does cost so much energy though. 

Guess it's my fault for not hiding it better though. There's no arguing with a wall. Doesn't matter what I say. Getting berated for over ten minutes over other stuff just because she found the coat. That piece of clothing was just another (very exhausting) attempt on doing something meaningful with my time, trying to find a reason not to kms. Or it's absolutely pointless and something to despair over, depending on my mood. 

Because of them criticizing everything I practically hide any interests and activities I am doing. Everything they see becomes worthless in my eyes. Therapist wanted me to talk to them for help but for me they've been incredibly toxic and damaging in my life and I've been trying to protect myself for years now. They're also the reason I needed (and still would need) therapy for years (they only meant well though! /s).

It just kills me that other people in my age are actual persons and I am locked in this eternal guerilla war with my parents where you have to fight over the smallest thing. Being years behind in development.",Depressed
"I'm doing something I wouldn't normally do, I'm sharing. I'm going to be honest, a few weeks ago I was so deep in I was planning suicide. I would have done it in less than a week from then, but then something just ""woke up"" inside of me. I just stood up and decided to take my life back. I'm still surprised how quickly I went from planning suicide to looking forward to something for once. For a few weeks I felt great.

I got a girlfriend, made new friends and even started socializing, but now I'm sinking back in. And I know that if I fully sink back in, I won't come back out. It's already happening. I've already started cutting again.

I know that nobody really cares, but I'm dying inside. It won't be long until I contemplate suicide again.

Today mum and uncle screamed at each other because they did not want to stay with grandma during the weekend (I decided to go back to uni, which is pretty far). They were so mean to each other, I was there thinking: ""If that is a family, I want to die alone"". Actually I just wanted to die. I felt like an asshole, and I was not even asking to go out to party, I asked to go and get an education, somenthing that both of them were able to get, while being full time students and not a partial care giver. They did not get me a car, as well, so they cannot rely on me if they need to, because with public transportation I take hours  to get home from uni. My other side of the family is so different. They have so much compassion for each other and me. There have been few times when their generosity and more than ever their attitude, moved me to tears. Sometimes it really feels so weird that they would help me like that, with a smile on and without letting me know how much of a weight I am. My grannie hairdresser came home to cut and style her hair, since she is still really weak. And while he was there he told grannie that everybody was missing her and he thanked her because he said that during all these years talking to her helped him to learn a lot (grannie was a teacher, and he dropped out of high school). He made her feel so happy and pretty. I nearly had to put the money directly into his pocket. He did not wanted it. I was so close to tearing up.

It's sort of meta.  I had some good days, and then afterward had kind of the ""recoil"" or the after shock when things felt like they went back to normal.  And when I talked about it in group, one of the peers there asked me about my isolation, when I started feeling like I was isolating, stuff like that.  I hadn't even realized that I was talking about isolation and being social and stuff.  I didn't even know if that's the topic I wanted to think about.  But the rest of the meeting I just kept thinking about it.  And I realized that isolation actually might be a huge thing for me.  It's probably connected to fear of vulnerability, to social anxiety, it might be caused by my frequent self-hate, or over criticism, or lack of self worth (many sides to the same coin).  It might be the middle ground that is caused by a few things I already know about myself, and is in turn the cause of a bunch of other things that I feel like are in the way of me making changes to my life.  It feels like it could be a huge thing to focus on!

We also talked about anger in meeting.  And although I think I have come a long way in getting better at identifying, disarming, defusing anger, that topic also sparked some recognition in me.  I think anger that I bottled up and maybe even ended up directing toward myself could have been a source of anti-social behavior, and isolating.  still not sure about that one.  but it's another thing to explore alongside isolation.  having early, nearly unlimited access to the internet definitely played into my isolation as a kid, and still does to a huge extent.  it's a problem.

"My close childhood best friend of 10-11 years committed suicide less than 2 months ago, cutting her wrists at a creek. I desperately miss her and regret so much, the what if’s eat me alive. She messaged me 3 days before she died, thanking me for being a beautiful friend. She told me she was going to do it. I knew she’d been feeling suicidal but we both had felt this way before, said stuff like this before & got through; I doubted her seriousness & assumed this wave of depression would pass and she would overcome it like always, but it consumed her. It all happened so fast, and there’s so many questions that will forever be left unanswered. I regret not seeing her more, not taking things more seriously. Especially for taking our beautiful friendship for granted. I can’t help but know I let her down, I could have saw her more, said more in the moment, I could have been more supportive and more involved in her life, but I was so self centered. So blind. I let her down and I don’t get a second chance. 

I’m becoming extremely depressed and suicidal. Suicided been on my mind before my best friend passed, but even more so now. I feel like my mental health has declined drastically in the last 4 - 5 years, but even before then I have not been very stable. 

When I try to change it up and do more to get out of this depressive state and change my outlook on my life, I pick things up and put it down two minutes later... I have tons of trouble sticking with healthy regiments, I give up too easily and become hopeless in results all too fast; it’s either I’m too far gone or I haven’t tried the right thing the right way.

 I’ve seemed to lose interest in what I like, I can’t be consistent in anything. I sing and write raps, try to do things I enjoy but I often cycle through things quickly and find myself empty still after. I’m getting major writers block because my self hatred has started to consume me so instead of getting somewhere, I just get frustrated. I have no idea what to do at this point. Sometimes I’m positive and happy but it’s all just an endless wave of bipolar mood swings. It doesn’t last long, I’m constantly up and down all day. 

I’m self diagnosing here, but I strongly believe (through mediocre research and forums) that I suffer from depression, social anxiety, high functioning anxiety, trauma from a stressing violent, neglectful childhood, and body dysmorphia (honesty one of the main reasons I’m feeling so suicidal and down lately, it’s hindering my everyday life at this point and making me avoid certain tasks and activities, because I’m easily triggered). 

My daily life and relationships are suffering because I’m neglecting my mental health.

i grabbed the capsule, opened it, took a pill and left. There’s a disconnect here. It hurts but the world isn’t nearly as black and white as it thought, how could i imagine humans were so simple. Does everyone hurt? Cause that’s what i’m led on to believe, a week ago i wondered if anybody could ever really love me. 42 days ago someone who i never would imagine saving me saved me, a piece of shit did a good deed. I don’t wanna see him again ever.

"Fighting depression for months. Got on a new med and started to feel better. Did a big shopping run and pinched a nerve in my back. Most if the heavy stuff is in the car, i dont dare lift it up the stairs.

I felt great with limitations and some pain, i cant lean forward or pick anything up, or tilt my head back (im getting dizzy). It felt so good to be getting something done. I only got a fraction of stuff done and now im stuck in bed for probably another 5 days or so. 
I am afraid to sleep because if i move the wrong way it makes me scream in pain them i have to try to slowly move so that the pinching stops.

I've always suffered in silence, so opening up like this, even to one person, is a pretty big step for me. In January, I told one of my best friends through Reddit. Whenever I say something that makes it sound like I'm depressed, he always says something like ""Bro stop being edgy."" I did say not to tell anyone else, so maybe he's just trying to make sure no one else suspects anything, but I'm starting to think he just might not believe me. Am I overreacting?

I've grown up to not be attached to anyone. I can be just as close and then vabish from their lives without any notice.  
  
I'm worried about something else. Although I've thought about the worst condition and made plans on how to adapt to it, subconsciously it's really been bugging me.  
  
The last 2 weeks have been hell. Had a cold (not coronavirus, although I wish I was diagnosed, and I became a casualty of it), then due to it wasn't as efficient as I could be. Lost time. Still I don't have enough energy as I used to few weeks earlier.  
  
Everything combined has been a shit past few weeks.  
  
I feel like binge eating chocolate and ice cream but I can't because that would affect my weight loss progress.

So, no one takes me seriously, I cannot get tested and so on.
I decided to extra catious and treat it like a infection with mild symptoms and self-isolate.
No problem for me I do 't like to go out and socialize anyways so much.

Now my mum asks me how I feel today and I say better, just a bit of sore muscles.
Her reply is just, oh well, good for you. Then it is probably just  cold.

He response in not taking me seriously and making things so small is really frustrating and makes me angry and makes me write the first post in days in here.

This is also how she treats other problems I have.

- everyone had hard times, you need to dealwith it yourself.. (thanks mum!, it was you who hit me as a child)
-just open those letters! it is not that hard (it is when you have a condition!)

On the way out someone said my hair was a toupee and I had a melt down when I got home. Self harmed and cut my hair a bunch. It hasn't gotten easier.

"This is a goodbye of sorts. I knew that March of 2020 would be make or break for me and it's obvious which way that has fallen and I've got a plan that will be acted upon.

I'm going to my third funeral this year next Monday. I don't want to get in to specifics of those circumstances but two of those people were younger than me. The latest one I was asked last year to get in contact with them because they'd like it and I never did, now I'll never see them again. 

A close friend of mine just left my life without any warning. Without getting in to details they were telling me they were still interested in seeing me then a week or two later just cut me off from all contact. This affected me more than I realised it could and having no closure or resolution is such a hard thing to cope. I miss them dearly but would have been accepting of the situation if I'd just been told. I hope that they are happy and successful in their future, I've tried to combat the hurt by being angry but I can't do it only wishing them all the best because when you care about someone then how they get happy doesn't matter only if they do.

Having them leave me in the circumstances that they did is irrefutable that I am a terrible person. Nobody who brings value as a person gets repeatedly left by everyone as I have. ""When everyone in the room is an asshole you're actually the one who is the asshole"" when everyone leaves me in these circumstances it's because the problem is myself and not them.

I've fallen down in to depression again and not willing to fight it for the umpteenth time. It's too hard, too draining, it never works permanently and everyone leaves me eventually.

I don't even know if I want to stay.  The only thing making me glad that it's me staying is how difficult I'm sure it is currently to get a job.

I've neglected friendships. I'm irritated/resentful toward my partner (who doesn't deserve it).

He said he still wanted to be friends but I feel in my heart that a small part of me is still hoping, and I have to let that go. So I said my final goodbye to him and now we’re strangers again. Again part of me wants to keep him in my life - he said we could still talk and do activities like running/rock climbing/gaming and the part of me that wants to keep him in my life is telling me to do these things as performances to show him that I was the non-depressed girl he fell in love with 4 years ago. And it is taking everything I have right now to not contact him. I wasn’t able to sleep but at least this way I’m more on track to fixing my sleep schedule.

"Day 4 post-breakup, yesterday I talked with friends whenever I wanted to message him. I realized that though I told him to never message me under any circumstances, I actually wanted him to know that I was open for a friendship in the future. I had a specific friend help me write that message in a way that allowed me the most freedom, empowerment, and choice, and I sent it to him. I’m so grateful for that friend. Other friends that I reached out to sent me cake pops! While in quarantine! Before that, they were asking me stuff that I liked. I never thought they would use those questions to do something nice for me. It was the most thoughtful gift I’ve ever received in years. I feel like this day will be a really good day after yesterday. I know I shouldn’t be too hard on myself if it ends up the opposite. It kind of feels weird that I feel a lot better. I was expecting myself to be extremely sad for at least 3 weeks. I guess today is just a good day. Today I might ask if any friend could help me throw away some stuff from my college apartment when quarantine is over. The last thing I did before leaving for spring break was have my boyfriend over and I feel like coming back to my apartment after getting broken up with would completely break me.

If there is a switch in the human brain that makes us ignore existential anxiety, mine is absolutely broken. I can’t even read about space and the universe because the vastness of the unknown makes me shrivel up inside. I used to love learning about nature but now new information terrifies me.

I’m an absolute wreck of a person. My siblings have told me that they think they have to worry about me every single day because I can’t take care of myself.

This is the first day of online classes and I can’t help but want to ask him how his classes were at the end of today but in place of that I will ask some friends instead. Today is a little more depressing because the weather isn’t that nice and I usually texted him more often during cloudy/rainy days.

My good friend asked me how I was doing. From our conversation I was able to recount a time that I felt so unloved and unappreciated. Thank god I remembered because my brain was starting to only remember the good times and I was starting to tell myself that everything was my fault. At the end of this day though, I still miss him.

I still can't find a psychiatrist under my insurance; I got put on a waitlist many months long. I need some refills and want to get help before my bipolar and hypomania get worse as it usually does with age.

I've been trying to diagnose a chronic health problem that's been causing me excruciating pain, to the point I couldn't walk for a week, and with the pandemic going on my specialists are cancelling appointments left and right. My specialist told me to go to the ER, which I did with great reservations and worries about catching COVID-19, then the ER told me to go to my specialist. They agree I need surgery but since it's not critical in the sense I'm not going to die immediately, I probably have to wait until everything settles down. Meanwhile I'll keep living in pain, I suppose.

I know I should be more concerned about what’s happening with the rest of the world but as far as I know my relationship is the only thing closest to me that has died. I keep thinking back to many moments where I was alone and would text him something random and I would be smiling at my phone when he replied. I have social anxiety and I was able to go out by myself a lot as long as I could tell him random stuff that popped into my head. Texting him was a huge comfort for me. I’m starting to daydream about scenarios where my growth is shown to him in some way and he feels regret. I accidentally saw another old picture of him and I deleted it right away.

No more movies to like forward to, no records to order, likely music will stop coming out cuz people can't go to studios Both of my jobs are gone so I can't make money and my mom can't work anymore, so will I even be able to pay for my apartment in the fall? Will that even happen? Will all this COVID bullshit still be happening in August? The hope that things will be back to normal in August is literally the only thing I have and that'll probably get ripped away too. I can't do anymore online classes. What am I just gonna take a semester off and wait? I don't wanna do that. My list of things keeping my going is essentially empty at this point and I don't know how I'm going to live in this fucking miserable world until the fall.

It still hurts though and I can feel it in my chest. It feels heavy and it makes me want to take deeper breaths. The weather tonight is kinda cold for the first time in a while and it made me think of happier times with him.

"1. Work:  I am currently ... furloughed? Disabled? I’m not sure. I’m an RN. I was nearing the end of my training period with plans to extend it when the pandemic hit. I’ve since been told that, as a severe asthmatic, I have respiratory restrictions I have to adhere to and therefore cannot be in the ER at this time. I feel I’m getting the run around and I’m near the point of getting fired. The anxiety is killing me and the idea that I’ll be sans job again is compounding on my depressive feelings of worthlessness. 

2.  Motherhood:  I find myself very easily annoyed by things LO does after the 10th time I’ve asked her not to do them. I find I cannot effectively communicate with her. I feel my PPD rear its ugly head every time she cries at a decision I’ve made or an action I’ve completed. It’s torturous.

3. Pandemic Stay-at-Home Period:  meh. I’m used to this. After I had LO, I was at home nearly 100% of the time for 2+ years. It’s pretty isolating itself having a child. Kind of like a plague that doesn’t kill anyone.

4.  Depression:  I’m still on the same med regimen. I’m trying to be a little more diligent about taking it since I have nothing but time on my hands to attempt to engage in self care. If nothing else it’s an experiment to really solidify no treatments work for me and I’ll be looking at a long, expensive road of off-label treatments. 

5.  Self Care:  still a 0/0. I managed to wash my face tonight. I ate dinner which was the only meal I had today. I got dressed. Beyond that, basic hygiene has gone outta the window. I’m really failing on GAF about myself.

If I’m not mindlessly scrolling my phone or distracted by something else, I just cry. I was consistently working out or at least breaking a sweat every day the last 2 weeks but this week everything just stopped and I can’t bring myself to get up and get moving. I feel guilty wasting all of this “extra free time” that I could be using to practice other hobbies but the moment I try to start a creative project I just want to give up because I’m not good at it.

-I've had nightmares about my closest friends dying and not being able to see them. It's good that they aren't real, but I have lucid dreams and it feels like it since I actually can make decisions. But every move I make doesn't change the fact they die.
-I've been good about getting groceries and staying careful, but I've lost weight because I'm not eating as much as I should since I don't feel like it. I've always wanted to lose weight, but not like this.
-I've been working from home, but I lack motivation, my colleagues are putting a lot of burdens on me as someone who was just hired three months ago, and there's just so much pressure on me. I can't escape it because my room and my workplace are now one in the same.
-I've been staying in my room for majority of my days, not just for work, but so I don't have to see my roommates for the majority of the day. I am jealous of their privilege to have their significant others in the same house and/or the same city, and seeing them enjoy themselves reminds me that I don't have the same opportunity. My semi-long distance relationship (1 hour away) wasn't as bad before this whole thing because we used to visit each other frequently in each other's cities. I am literally starved for affection and time and so is he, but we can't do anything more due to the workload of our jobs and the mental exhaustion that comes from it. I've never truly hated my roommates because of this since we've been friends for more than a decade, but it makes me hate myself for not having the motivation to reach out and put in the work to be with friends, my bf, my family, etc through these online platforms.",Depressed

People told me to see this relationship as a lesson to help navigate my next one but I just can’t seem to let go of the thought of “I don’t want a next one, I want to keep working on the one that failed.” I’m really desperate to get over him because I don’t want to be hung up over him down the line and be miserable when he finds the person he chooses to love forever. But the future I saw with him was so happy, warm, bright, and a relief from the broken house I have grown up in. He was the one for me but I wasn’t the one for him and that just really fucking sucks. I’m trying to do everything I can to not be hung up on him in the future because I know if I don’t do anything about it right now, then I’m going to be heartbroken at everything he does in the future and he’ll never even know a thing... which would make me feel so pathetic.

I've had depression in the past and the therapists said that I was cleared of it, but I find myself stuck in the exact same position as back then. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like my parents would be glad if I would be gone as they'd have to spent less money overtime.

The only reason why I haven't gone back to suicide attempts or cutting myself is because summer is coming, I won't be able to hide the cuts and (my country isn't in complete lockdown yet, we are advised to stay home as much as possible tho) because quite some people are outside. Last time I did an attempt (like 3-4 years ago I think, I don't remember exactly) one of my old teachers recognized me and brought me back home after calling my mother.

I don't know what to do anymore, I feel like it's be better to no longer be here, but at the same time I don't wanna traumatize train/car/bus drivers, I've done my research and even though cutting wrists may be painful it's one of the easiest way to go out, all you need to do is make sure you cut the arteries and you're done for if people don't find you in time.

I wanna run away from home burn off my fingerprints and make sure that when I die my face can't be recognised I know I need help but to me it would feel like I would be wasting people's time. I just want it all to stop. I've been always been emotional (mostly violent and sad) and I no longer feel like I'm one inside, I feel like those sides have split off and I'm afraid they're gonna take me over.

What's also been helping is practicing gratitude for what I do have, and that it's not just me or my friends or city, but the entire country. Unfortunately my roommates/best friends aren't doing quite as well but I hope that my pushing through each day and daily mindfulness exercises inspire them.

"[24 M] First time in the sub, figured I’d just use this as a space to throw some thoughts down.

I’m unemployed as of mid-March due to Covid-19 shutting my workplace down, and am in quarantine with my girlfriend who I share a studio apartment with.

Started antidepressants (Wellbutrin 150mg/day) about 3 weeks ago for first time in a couple years (about 2 I think). Was never super consistent with them in the past for a bunch of reasons not worth delving into. I now have a different perspective (and deepened state of depression) that has made me want to be consistent with meds in a way I never have felt. Also started talk therapy (video chat for now due to covid-19) around the same time, which has been going okay, though I’m only 2 real sessions in. Haven’t gotten back into any form of exercise yet, though considering trying to go for a light jog today.

I accomplished a few things over the weekend - I did the laundry for my gf and I (she’s employed still and WFH so I’ve been trying to do more house stuff when I have the spoons) which had been overflowing for about a week. I have been doing okay with cooking for myself & my gf and eating somewhat healthily (not so much healthily, but more consistently which is better than what my diet has been in recent past). I did the dishes (which is a much more exhausting task now that we have to cook and eat EVERYTHING at home). I took the recycling out. I tidied up my bedside table. Swept the floor a bit. Put away my clean clothes that have been sitting in the hamper. 

All in all, I did a lot of stuff and I’m trying to recognize that without focusing on everything I haven’t done or won’t do, or the fact that all those things are simple and should be easy, or any other intrusive thought I may have at any given moment. 

I haven’t had much motivation in my life, especially since professionally I’ve kind of lost all hope and passion for my field. But I’m also terrified at the thought of having to work on a resume and find a different job and interview and learn new skills and adapt to a new environment and all that. 

Things are still really really hard. Every day is hard and I spend a lot of time just trying to hold it together. I had a bad breakdown last night but I actually cried instead of feeling complete emptiness and inability to even feel sad. So it’s definitely good I’m starting to feel more of the full spectrum of my emotions, even if it’s shitty and hurts to do so.

I want to start living my days with more purpose. I’ve always been resistant to writing even though I do like it sometimes, but writing comments like this is so helpful. Even if literally no one sees it or responds. I have never been one to journal, and every time I try I lost focus or motivation and never keep it going. 

I have so many thoughts on my mind, I know I’d benefit to practice meditating. Maybe I try that now. I hope you’re doing well if you’re reading this. I have love for you, and I know we can all move through any hardship we may be facing right now. This life can be cruel and unforgiving, and that’s why it’s so important to practice radical love as much as we can. We are all in this fight together❤️",Depressed
"Been a bad start to the week here. I felt like I was coping pretty well with quarantine and working from home for a few weeks, but suddenly I have no focus, barely feel able to get out of bed, can’t sleep when I am supposed to and have zero appetite. I’m supposed to be working from home but I’m a wet bench researcher so I barely have anything to do. I feel totally useless and completely unmotivated to do anything. 

I was accepted to a PhD program and am starting this fall but after a month of not being in lab I’m scared that I won’t be ready. I feel like this quarantine has really set back my research skills, my work ethic and my social skills. Heck, I can’t even bring myself to read a single paper today. 

Things will get better but it sure is hard to believe it right now. I hope everyone else is having a better Tuesday than this lazy slug :(",Depressed
"About to finish college. My episodes haven’t been as frequent as it has in the past but they are lasting much longer, thanks to the quarantine forcing to sit alone with my thoughts 24/7. Feel lost and don’t know what to, where to go, or whether I even want to get up out of bed and finish my assignments so I can actually graduate. On top of that, I genuinely hate feeling stuck in life, and when I can’t physically go somewhere (I love being on the move), my depression hits especially hard since it forces me to think of all the stuff I am probably trying to run away from. Never posted here before but I hope everyone else is doing well and surviving through these tough times.",Depressed
Don’t really want to make a whole post about this. Sometimes I feel like I am just attention seeking but I really don’t want any attention and have no attention.

Day 3 checking in here. Today has been rough good but rough I started with opening my curtains after waking up I noticed it was a bit rainy out but that didn't make me anxious at all I was still kind of sleepy. I poured myself a cup of coffee I used the mug that my science teacher gave me last year it has the periodic table and actually glows when the hot liquid is poured in it's pretty cool and keeps my mind off the bad stuff. Anyway I also wrote in my diary and thought more about what I wanted to do next year. Since last week I've been practicing my yoga and special breathing excersises I think they are really well and so far I feel better after doing them. I got really depressed earlier but I tried not to think about it that much and ending up sorting through some old photos I had which cheered me up but then made me sad at some memories. I think tomorrow will be better and will keep checking in.,Depressed

The thought of reaching a goal that could result in me learning stuff I care about and breaking free of my mundane life is unbelievably freeing.

She used to mock my depression and throughout all these years, I had to hide that side of me infront of her because she didn't like that. 
After trying to play online games, I threw my phone away and kept weeping. I can't stop. I want to hurt myself. It has been almost two years since I last cut my hands and all. I want to do it so badly. I want to smoke a cigarrete and give burn in my body. I really want to hurt myself. I know I will be fine after couple of hours or so.

Every single one of you proved how little you cared one way or another. And you know what? I don't blame any of you. But I also don't feel guilty either.

In january my father was murdered, and now every day sucks. I've gone through anger. Shit, for the past 4 months i plotted to break into police lockup and murder the dude. Now it's all sadness. I miss my father, i miss my girlfriend i broke up with right before his death. 

I want to go back to december. I was literally the happiest person alive and everyone can confirm that. No matter what shitty thing happened i laughed and carried on. I even got hit by a fucking truck a few years back and walked it off, pranking my ex on messenger while i was waiting for head surgery, now i have a cool scar to show. Life was so fucking simple. Go to concerts, watch Adventure Time with one of the most amazing women i've ever met, play on console while she's using my PC to study.

Day 30 post breakup. Tonight was a little hard because I was stressing over an assignment and I normally texted him when I was stressed. I still have not been able to kick my habit of checking to see if he’s online or not. He normally goes online to game but he wasn’t online at all for the entire day so that made me feel anxious because I started wondering what he was doing. I felt this way during the relationship sometimes when he would go hang out with his friends but my heart was always eased when he would text me that he was on his way back. Sadly I’m not going to feel that same reassurance tonight and I’m afraid that’s what a tiny part of me is hoping for. I thought a lot about him today as well and felt some pain. Again it’s still not as painful as it was a week ago so I know I’m making progress there but it’s starting to get irritating how I keep having these sad feelings. I just want to get over him already,Depressed

"so...
I started suspecting I had many mental health problems since I was around 13 years old (I'm 16 now) . I educated myself a lot on psychology through reliable sources at a very young age. some of these problems I realised the symptoms very early on but I couldn't do anything about it and some of these problems I only realised the symptoms recently. I don't really have access to therapy either since my parents don't know anything because I hide it really well. I've been trying to get it off my mind but my friends really aren't educated on it. if I may say, they probably don't give a shit abt my mental health but they're the only friends I have anyway so ya. I need a place to talk about this and feel validated sort of? so yeah. here are some problems I think I may be dealing with.

They aren’t yelling at each other all the time now and have started to share the same bed. Back then their issues always found their way into my relationship and my ex would witness the brunt of the effects a damaged family had on a person. After watching so many self-help videos recently and hearing over and over that adult issues come from early childhood I just can’t help but feel like everything in my entire life has all been some cruel joke to me. When I was happy and in love my family fell apart, my older brother told me to kill myself, and I was unknowingly driving my ex away. Now that I’m depressed and heartbroken my parents are being civil, that same older brother got a high-paying internship and my ex is probably feeling overjoyed?

"Hey everyone, I’m new to this community, but I guess this would be a great way for me to just vent.
I guess for starters, I’ve been feeling pretty awful. 
I’ve pushed all of my friends away, pushed my now ex away (blocked her) and although I tend to prefer being isolated in my own little cocoon as I like to put it, I really feel alone now.
I reconnected with a few people recently and although it was brief, I did get to hear updates on their lives. Hearing from them was nice, but hearing about all the things they’ve achieved just made me feel worse. 
I haven’t done anything with my life. I’m 22, have student loan debt with no degree to show for it and I live with my father. I quit after my first semester due to an incident that happened to me and I flunked all of my classes that semester too. I’ve been having health issues ever since that incident occurred and the doctors I’ve seen can’t seem to pinpoint what’s wrong with me. I’ve gained 100 lbs, regained my terrible eating habits and feel like I’ve changed entirely this past year and half...for the worst. I feel like I’m so far behind and as if life is just swallowing me up, bit by bit with each passing day. I feel like a failure and I feel so uncomfortable living in father’s house. My father has his own family to tend to with his wife and kids and I can tell that she isn’t exactly content with me living there. I know he won’t admit it, but I can just tell when I’m not welcomed. Maybe not from my father, but from my step mother. 

My mother’s also been treating me strangely and I’ve been feeling a bit resentful towards her as well, which makes coming by for visits a bit difficult. I don’t hate her, but I have so much pent up anger towards her, it’s insane how long it took me to realize this. 
I keep looking back to the past and imagining that everything was different. That I had the life I wanted..that I was able to be a child for once. It’s odd how much I wish I was kid again. I’ve always struggled to act my age and I wish I didn’t grow up so quickly. I wish I didn’t have to deal with so many complications growing up. I wish I wasn’t the oldest child. I wish I had someone I can look to for guidance and understanding. 
I wish my mother was there for me as I was there for her. I wish I didn’t have to be in the middle of the mess she got herself into. I wish she was a good parent. 
I just want someone to be there for me unconditionally, but then again how would that even be possible if I keep pushing everyone away.
I have so much pain in me, but I can’t seem to let it out appropriately like others do. I feel numb most of the time, with the exception of a few tears here and there, but then I’m instantly overcome by numbness once more.
I feel lost, hopeless and helpless. 
I know that in order to turn my life around, I need to be there for myself and I know I can’t rely on others “fix” me, but then again, maybe that’s one of the issues here. I can’t seem to let myself rely on anyone. I pay for everything and do everything myself, with the exception of rent, but even that makes me uneasy. 
I just wish I wasn’t me. I think I’m too idiotic to do anything productive in this world and my existence feels meaningless.",Depressed

To begin with I didn't know if it was something that I wanted to do, it wasn't my plan at all (my plan was a PhD).

Umm...maybe in Europe but in America that's simply not true. Certain things are out of reach solely based on how much your family can afford.

How am I supposed be motivated to continue pursuing my dream when even if I can barely survive my depression+school situation, it doesn't matter... What's the point, someone please tell me.

I feel like I’m slipping through the cracks. I feel like I’m disappearing into nothing but sadness. I want to get away from this depression but how can you get rid of a chemical imbalance? I want to cry all the time and also do nothing at all. I’m both numb and feel like I’m breaking at the same time. I feel useless and lazy and that I’m not good at anything. The hopelessness is overwhelming and all consuming. I know it gets better but when?

My roommates are lovely but having too much positivity around me is irritating and exhausting right now. My dad who is suffering from short-term memory loss due to a stroke called me for the hundredth time this week and it makes me sad whenever I have to talk to him. Quarantine has been on and off getting to me. Thinking about how much of a disappointment I am to myself and others.

Every little thing upsets me, I don't have the will to do anything.. can't even get out of bed to eat or shower. My boyfriend needs me now more than ever cause he's going through a nasty custody battle with his ex. But with everything going on I've been neglecting him and became distant. I take offense even to his jokes and I've been treating him awful.. he's calling me out on it and I get upset about it. I am toxic and I think it'd be best if I take some time to myself. But I don't think he's gonna want to take me back once I'm all better, not that I still deserve it. I've left him during the time he needed me the most.

"Lately, my stomach has been hurting. It gets worse when I think about my friends and how i miss them. Wednesday was the first day back to work since the lockdown. The office is only open one day a week for now. The moment I had taken my coat off and sat down with the others I began to cry, which I hadn't seen coming, but nobody held it against me. That's one of the many reasons I love them so much. I felt that I had no right to, because I know the terrible pressure everyone's under, especially our boss. She's responsible for everyone's well-being as well as our safety, two things that don't come together in this crisis. We all know that if she had the opportunity she'd open up at full capacity tomorrow. I could see it in her face. You just don't get cut off from everyone and everything you know and love and the day to day routine that gives purpose to your life without repercussions. I met with a friend yesterday and we walked around for two hours and talked about nothing. That was nice. It's her birthday tomorrow. I still dreaded going home, so I went to the community center, which was open. We had to sit five feet apart, but the coffee was hot and just sitting there listening to the others talk about knitting and dogs was awesome. Afterwards one of the others and I bought groceries for the weekend. I made meat sauce from scratch for dinner. I thought maybe I'd feel better if I picked up the place a little, so I did a load of laundry, loaded the dishwasher and took the garbage out. Today I took a very long walk, replaced the flowers on my friend's grave, bought a bottle of diet soda and fed the cats. Afterwards I made a jelly roll and banana bread.

You don’t really feel that way” but immediately less than I second later I’m thinking “but don’t I?” And I didn’t know the answer to that question.  I just never come to positive conclusions and and I don’t even know if I want to. People always say you “have to want” things and I just don’t feel it.

"Day 43 post breakup. Currently experiencing a lot of anxieties that are time sensitive that have nothing to do with him, and it has caused me to have 3 bad days in a row.

I was just happy to get a reply from him. But now that outlet is not here and I’ve been doing constant breathing exercises + stretches + positive self affirmations to no avail. 

At this point I know I did not deserve to receive such inconsistency and uncertainty from this guy for the years we spent together. But right now all my brain is telling me is that he is the only thing that can alleviate my anxieties so I deserve any kind of message from him.

I'm quite sure depression runs in my family, but I didnt figure that out until just 3 years ago. Knowing that helped me understand some of my emotions. First time I expressed that I wanted to kill myself was at seven years old. I wrote it on a piece of paper that my teacher later found. Who knows if it was just a child expressing themselves without thinking of the meaning of it. At 14 I actually attempted suicide by swallowing a shit ton of pills, however, I called the ambulance myself and had to drink some tar like liquid... this was because of my first bf breaking up with me. It wasnt depression, just a sensitive emo girl who acted out. 

Now I'm 26. I moved 5h away from family when I was around 20. The feeling of emptiness and questioning the existence of myself and human kind increases year by year. Sometimes it gets better and I actually enjoy the small miracles that life can offer, but I cant help to constantly question the meaning of it. Of anything, really. 

I have a fiancé. He is the love of my life and my support. He suffers from depressive ruts every now and then and I try to be his safe spot. The majority of the time, he is the life of the party. He sets the energy of a room, no matter if he tries or not. We have a dog together. Fluffy little thing. This is the family that I love and live for.

I've since joined the military in hopes I can atleast die for my country. All I can say is that if your sad over a short term issue (breaking up with somebody, bad grades in school,  the death of a pet, etc.) Then things will indeed get better, but you have to be proactive with it, even a death in the family is hard to handle but with time it can heal.

I haven't had the energy to clean neither myself nor the apartment. It smelt like feet. And the 20-gallon garbage bag that was overflowing two weeks ago didn't help much. Today I'd had enough, so I lit a yankee candle, cleaned the kitchen, loaded the dishwasher twice, baked a funfetti cake, dusted the entire apartment, did two loads of laundry, cleaned the bathroom, bought and put away groceries, took out the trash, cleaned the cat boxes and replaced the litter, vacuumed the couch, the bed and cat towers, changed the sheets, organised the bookcase, TV stand and art supply cabinet, aired out the rugs and vacuumed and mopped the floors twice. I even put on a fresh tablecloth. It took seven hours but it was worth it. I still feel like crap, but at least now I can feel like crap in a clean house. It's nice now and smells like soap and cake. I think I'll have lasagna tonight. Love you all ~",Depressed

But I've been struggling to create positive habits and routines, especially as a grad student with no classes or regular commitments or schedule. I've spent the last month spiralling into a pattern of avoidance, even though all of my work can be done from home so in theory the quarantine doesn't need to stop me. I accepted today that I'm not just following old patterns, I'm properly depressed, and I don't really know what to do about it.

"I fell back in the hole today. I could feel it start to cave in on me while the darkness started to roll in like a storm- and I couldn’t do anything about it. One of the worst parts of depression is when you start to feel the first “signs and symptoms” and you know you just have to ride it out. I was in the shower and all of the sudden I could feel that creeping dread, and just started saying “no no no, please stop”. I got out put my robe on and just started sobbing uncontrollably. I miss everything about who I used to be...I just want to be normal. I can’t stop crying, and I just want it to stop.",Depressed

"Been a few years since I last posted here, and I'm pretty happy to say that things have been a lot better recently.

I spent a few months at a rehab center about 2 years ago, and from there I got not only support from the people working there that I desperately needed at the time, but I also got the opportunity of my life - a chance to leave my garbage home town for good.

With the help of the staff at the center, I was able to muster up the strength to apply for a special needs school in another city, and actually got the spot too. While it's been a bit too easy in comparison to when I was still in high school, I also don't feel like I don't have a future anymore. We proceeded to move into the city around half a year later, and things have only gotten better since.

My relationship with my father is nothing more than a fading memory at this point, and I couldn't be happier about that fact. I feel a bit guilty every now and then about leaving my friends behind as well by changing my phone number and not continuing to contact them, but the less I have to think of my childhood, the better. I'm currently studying business and I'm hoping to get a proper degree from it within the next 5 or 6 years.

 I never interacted that much over here when I was in my darkest moments, but the support I got from the few posts I made here still contributed to my journey to bettering myself, and I couldn't be more grateful to the people here for it. Thank you so very much.",Depressed

"I had a good weekend by all accounts! Saturday I woke up relaxed and clear headed. I had an easy morning off and cut my hair, trimmed my beard, took my first shower in weeks, brushed my teeth, read my book and listened to music. I was planning on going to an art show opening that evening. But after all that good feeling, I amost backed out. 
No, I determined that I came this far, I should go be inspired (I was). I'm an artist too, that hardly produces art sometimes, most of the time. 
At the art show I was inspired and motivated. I listened to a wonderful local singer/songwriter and bought her CD. The whole way back I listened to this CD and was on a high of artistic stimulation. As soon as I pulled into the driveway at home I started feeling a deflation. I went to bed so I wouldn't ruin my perfect day. 
Sunday morning I woke up and felt pretty good! I played the CD again and was transported to the good feelings of yesterday.  Then I remembered  that I had wanted to check out a church Sunday morning. I went there the previous weekend to hear a string quartet perform and had thought I should come back for a service sometime. Since I was already all cleaned up, I went. It was worth it. I enjpyed coffee after service and chatting with some other  people. It was nice. I went home and started feeling all deflated again and the dullness returned.
I was supposed to go to a superbowl party at the neighbors  ut almost skipped it. I took a nap and set my alarm just in case. I woke up in a panic about the food I said I'd bring. I made it and arrived at the party a half hour late. It was pleasant and I enjoyed the conversations. I got home, intending on painting but was so deflated that I couldnt start. Instead I read and went to sleep. I escaped sinking into despair, by sleeping.
Monday morning came and I was feeling pretty positive. I looked around and saw a week's worth of dirty dishes filling all the counter space and sinks. I determined I would do two things all day; paint and do dishes. I cleaned up a space to paint and pulled out my easel and canvas and set it up. I listened to music and started my painting. I got all the dishes done! I wanted to finish my painting Monday before going into work at 8pm, but there were too many dishes and then I resented myself for letting things go for so long, and for not getting more done on my painting. 
I drove into work depressed as hell, but once I got there, I settled into a routine and felt good about my work. This morning I drove home and started sinking into a dismal place of no joy. Here it is almost noon and I'm staring at my half-finished painting. I'm functioning but feel so dead to anything, and dreading going back to work this afternoon.
I should feel elated over such an amazing weekend, and I mouth the words that it was amazing, like it happened to someone else.

I don’t know if I’m depressed per se - I more just feel detached, rejected, and hopeless. I really need someone to tell me it’s going to be ok and that this is normal and will pass, because I know it will.

"I've been diagnosed with clinical depression for a whole decade now, first being diagnosed in jr high. I also have extreme anxiety ADHD. It's gotten so much worse in the last couple of years, I only seem to have lows and I feel unable to enjoy any aspect of my life. I feel so lost and hopeless for the future, and it seems as though I can't rely on my friends or family to help at all.

I'm struggling with being independent as an adult. It just seems so impossible to achieve, when I have worked I struggle almost every shift with panic attacks to the point where I can't return to my old workplaces. College has been easier than working, but I have no idea what career to pursue and now that I have my AA degree there's not really a point in going to university without knowing that.

I've come to realize I can't decide on a major or career path because I don't really seem to know a whole lot about myself. It just feels like depression has become my identity and is consuming my entire life. I can't remember what it's like to not be depressed, I think I have a hard time identifying progress because of it. I keep trying but I keep getting lows that are incredibly destructive and frustrating, which is relatively new for my symptoms.

I keep lashing out at others, so I feel like I have to keep my distance. When I try to think more positively it just seems to make it worse. The things I normally do to cope aren't really working, I don't know what I should really do or what I really can do. 

I've been wanting to go to a therapist or something, but I don't really have any control over my situation because I am still entirely dependant on my father, who refuses to see my mental illness.

It's not just about him. I'm depressed about a lot of things. But he was the trigger and grieving what can't be with him makes it worse.

We do an activity with a lot of close physical contact, and I see him frequently for that. I can't avoid him for long without stopping doing that activity, which also helps me manage my depression. He's an amazing, supportive friend and one of the few people who can make me feel better. He spends a lot of time and energy trying to help me. I'm so grateful to him for that.

"Sorry, mobile post but..
Im just laying in bed wishing I could stop thinking about the people I hurt.

I feel like this needs some backstory.. So, afew years ago, (2015-2016) I was younger, and stupid. I didn't think about any consequences, or anything. I was bratty and childish and did what I wanted and said what I wanted. It didn't matter to me if what I was doing was mean, or cruel.. Sometimes I wanted it to be. I lived on this high of putting people down, shutting people down, using them, lying, cheating.. anything I thought I could get away with, I did. And I regret every bit of it.

I guess it came from my childhood, I don't know why but I'm guessing that's where I got that mean streak in me. My father was an undiagnosed bipolar, (who got diagnosed last year) and my mother just let him run rampant.. my brothers were cruel to each other and me, so I guess that's how that started.

Back on topic, I am basically a monster. I went around telling my """"friends"""" to kill themselves, despite their depression. I made my friend group fight on purpose, I am just evil. There's no excuse for it I just am. 
I came to a realization that I was a monster after one of my victims forgave me in 2018, even though I was actively helping his boyfriend cheat on him. (Unhealthy, monstrous, I know.)
I just realized what a big piece of shit I was and I've been trying so fix it, I've been trying to be a good person.. but sometimes I still slip back into the thinking of being like, cruel. I know I'm in no place to throw a pity party but I just, don't know what to do I feel so guilty all the time, I'm just a monster.

I'm sorry this is such a mess.",Depressed

I just joined the group to just to acknowledge that I am not 100% okay. I have a job, a wife, and a kid and they are pretty much the only motivations for getting out of bed every day. Every day I have to put on “The mask” the face I put on in front of people so I appear normal. Some days the mask gets heavier and some it’s lighter and the days aren’t a total waste. I accidentally told my wife about the bad thoughts during a fight and made me go to a counseling session. The counselor thought my anxiety and depression were linked. I still worry that my wife worries about me. Am I really going through something or is it just a phase?",Depressed

But here I am, some lovely night, lonely night, feeling like drowning again. Drowning in the dark middle layer of the ocean, seeing no light, only nothingless. 
Why am I here? I ask. 
I don't know, I answer to myself. 
I wish I knew. I wish I had a reason. I wish I wasn't depressed. I wish it could disappear. I wish I could breath in and out forever. 
But it won't, I say. You will drown. Quietly. 

It's okay, I reassure. 
You did it once, you've drown. You know how to swim now. You learned. 

You learned you could sink all the way down, and still be alive. 
You learned everything could be okay. You learned feeling like dying was okay. You accepted it was part of who you were, a depressed person. You sat on a bench, stopped being, watching hours as they were passing by, because the world had no meaning. 
No one has a meaning, I retork, not even me.
And that's okay.

Somehow, you went up, breathed again. 
I want a cookie, I say.
A cookie? I ask.
Yes, a cookie, because if nothing has a meaning, at least I want to enjoy a cookie, just because cookies taste good. It has no meaning, but nothing has a meaning.  At least I can please myself and not regret being alive today, when really, I don't know why I'm alive and conscious.

That's great, I conclude. You found your reason to breath.

And now they’re gone and I feel more depressed than I have in a long time. 

And I have no one to talk to about it. Everyone I know has their own problems already, I shouldn’t be offloading mine on them— depression, drug problems, etc. I’m usually the one that listens to their problems, so if I’m a burden on them then who will they be able to go to?",Depressed

I’ve lost interest in my hobbies and my girlfriend. I’ve been dumping 5+ hours of gaming a day to try to feel the joy I once felt before. Now I just want to lay in bed forever.

"Hello to anyone reading.  
  
Writing here after a long time here since I really want to say it somewhere.  
  
I've been putting myself through the grindstone, really trying to push through.  
  
But I feel that whatever I do my efforts aren't enough and all my efforts would be in vain.  
Today has been the lowest point for me on the past few weeks. Didn't feel like waking up, or doing anything but I had to. Whenever something happens which hampers in what I wanted to do makes me feel even more bad. The past few days have been like this only.  
  
I just want this to be over. Today was so bad I didn't feel like talking to anyone. Was inviting people today in my class, instead of giving verbal invitation I sent them WhatsApp messages to avoid any conversation.  
  
It's come to a long where sleeping and eating feels like a waste of time to me. I know it's wrong but I can't shake the feeling. Today at any mention of someone loosing life or not waking up tomorrow in any conversation whatsoever made me think, wish I was there. I wouldn't have to go through this anymore.  
  
I'll try and push through but I don't know how long before I break down and give up on myself.  
  
I really want to tell this to my family but I can't, since I'm not with them and it will give them unnecessary worries which they can't afford at this point of time, not will I share this with any friends I have.  
  
I only wish for this struggle to be over, but I have a feeling that this is just the beginning and I'll never be able to rest until I die (whenever my death will be).",Depressed

So Idk where to start but I guess it started when I moved in with this great guy and then started sleeping with the roommate and then broke up with bf and he moved out. Once the bf moved I started sleeping with this other guy cuz he really seemed to care then all of a sudden the room mate told me he loved me and I didn’t feel that way at the time and politely told him. I broke his heart so much he broke the lease. I moved into the place the other guy I was seeing which was with coworkers. After about a month I started sleeping with the roommate again. 2 weeks after that I found out I was pregnant. I never wanted kids ever... I had a druggy mother with hiv.. I didn’t think I would be a good parent it’s my biggest fear bigger than my fear of killing myself and of being alone... anyway I didn’t know who the dad was... in the end I got an abortion. I fell into a state of depression my work started declining and then more people moved into the pace I was at. I had to sleep in the living room with 4 people next to a dining table and liter box... the place smelled and trash everywhere. My anxiety thru the roof. I moved into my grands... my grandfather is a egotistical rich guy who talks down to everyone and manipulates everyone by buying them things. He judges. I lost my job. The roommate I’m still with the only one now. He still loves me and is willing to work with me on my issues but won’t commit to relationship like I’ve told him I want and I can’t blame him. I’m a mess. I haven’t had a job in a month and I’m running out of money. All my things are in a unit so if I don’t pay I lose everything go own. This all doesn’t sound so bad but idk how to handle it anymore every time I break up with a guy everything just explodes into chaos. One thing after another... I’m sick of trying to bounce back every time. I’m scared to get into a relationship but I’m scared to be alone. There’s so much more back story but I’m just exhausted living thru all the things I’ve had to go thru. This is just the most recent. I was cheated on so many times idk if I can stop sleeping around. I want one person but idk how to be normal I’m sick of mood swings I’m sick of family I’m sick of living like my druggy hiv mother who’s lived with her parents her entire life... I don’t want to go sown that road but I really think I’m going to end up that way. Idk what to do ims ick of starting over and at this point I’m just rambling ims o upset and I’m just thinking I can go plug my exhaust and just fall asleep and it’ll and just peacefully end...

"Been feeling less sad, but at the cost of feeling more numb. Kind of a double-edged sword, because I feel less stressed out than before, but my mental faculties have weakened. Haven't fully cried in a very long time, most I can muster is a couple of tears. Still tired each time I wake up.

And each time I begin to feel even a little bit happy I just question if I'm really depressed or not, or if I'm just faking it all. Especially because sometimes there are periods of time in which I am not as sad/numb as usual and am able to slightly enjoy some things.

What makes it worse is that I don't feel like I deserve to be depressed because many other people have it worse than me. I haven't gone through any traumatic experiences, am not struggling as much as others, etc.

Even when I hear others say the opposite, it still doesn't feel right. What they say makes sense, but it still doesn't feel right.

College is still a major source of my depression. My grades have been slipping once again as my will to continue this educational path slowly disappears. What's worse is that I'm on a full ride scholarship, which emphasizes how much is being wasted by my mere feelings.

I wish I could go talk to someone else, like a counselor or a friend. But I can't trust anyone. Not even myself. Haven't been able to for a long time. And I have no friends, no significant other, especially cause I'm not much of a social person (shy, introverted, constantly nervous around people, and low self-esteem). In addition, I wouldn't want to expose them to the mess that is me, wouldn't want to infect them with my pessimism and depression. And even if I find someone who can look past all of that shit and still be with me, I'd still probably just drive them away. Cause the part of me that is like my father (brash, brazen, short temper, etc) will then probably surface. And that would most likely cause mental damage, like it did to me.

Just better to spare them and myself of any pain.

Also, the clash of emotions and logic in my mind is tearing me apart. I know that I need to seek help, cause it's the logical thing to do. But something in me just can follow up on that. I know that I need to do something, cause it's the logical thing to do. But I just can't. It's easier and less strenuous to just do nothing at all. To ignore anything that might cause me stress. To ignore the mess that my life is.

And I'm able to analyze myself similar to how a therapist might do. I know that my feelings of low self-esteem we're worsened by my father in the past, by him frequently calling me dramatic, lazy, ungrateful, and weak when expressing my feelings and the like. I know that I have a fear of disappointing others, especially when people expect too much from me. I know that my mistrust of others is partly because of me being taken advantage of others my age in the past by being intellectually smart but weak to social pressure (carrying group projects and the like). I know that one reason I have no friends is because I lack social skills and am not interesting, with little to contribute to conversations. I know that part of my insecurities is a result of being pressured to follow in my older brother's footsteps, to do as well as he did, yet failing to do so. I know that I have frequently contradicting feelings and emotions because there is no solid, definite me. And I know many other things.

But even with this, I just can't piece it together. With all of this that I know, I just can't do anything. I'm just a jumbled mess that is somehow still intact. I'm surprised I haven't gone crazy.

Maybe because all I do with this emotional baggage is just cram it back into the deepest parts of my mind, out of sight. Quarantined to an extent.

Forgotten until I dig it back up while doing things like writing this comment. And after that, back to the darkness it goes.

"Sure. I moved into supervisory roles after a short time. So I learned a lot about delegating tasks to different personality types, metrics and measurements, etc. But the most important stuff was customer psychology and motivations. 

The woman you had an encounter with won’t make any more fuss, I’m sure. Just be as polite as possible and the rest is out of your control. Even if she does return for more discounts or whatever, your company, unless it’s a small, privately-owned company, doesn’t care about a few discounts.

I also started thinking about how eventually we will have to say goodbye permanently and at some point when one of us dies and everyone else I love (idk when) and I'll have to rely on myself. That terrifies me because I can't even pretend to be happy very well on my own. I just want to feel like I can trust myself, but I'm not quite there yet and I wonder if I'll ever get there.

"I have recently walked out of my job, and I am suffering a weird mix of emotions. I feel like one huge burden has been removed from my shoulders, only to be replaced by a new one. I keep asking myself “what now?” I know I have bills to pay, everyone does, but I just feel like my mental health is much more important. And now, since I want to prioritize that, the idea of searching for my next job is giving me anxiety. I have never had a passion for anything besides writing, something my depression has indefinitely taken away from me. I feel like I couldn’t handle picking myself up and trying again, only to be in the same place I’ve been before, and then that’s where my suicidal thoughts make their return.

I find myself thinking a lot “you could just die.” It’s always an option for me, but I’m too afraid of the WHAT IFS. What if I don’t fully overdose and I just end up fucking myself over and being even more miserable? What if I just cause my family even more pain if they have to care of me? What if I do succeed and I’m reincarnated into a water flea? (It’s a joke but seriously, who knows?) I just hate living life everyday like this.

I'm falling asleep for more time I used to earlier.  
  
This not only in gym, is affecting me in other spheres aswell. My studies are getting affected aswell.  
  
I believe it's due to some subconscious mental block due to upcoming move to different town/state coming up in few weeks.  
  
But this has increased my insecurities. It's making me feel so bad, and that I'll fail big time when it'll really matter.  
  
Worst of all I can't take a break cuz no leaves are allowed for the time being, can't leave early one day because apparently unless I have some physically manifested disease I'm fine (even though I might be feeling suffocated and heavy headed), additionally they're putting additional lectures extending day till 7-8pm.

"My family and I moved across the country away from where I went to high school and college about half a year ago, and I was dealing with some pretty bad relocation depression. After a few months, it started calming down. I met someone, and we got along really well and started dating. Being away from all of my friends didn’t seem so bad anymore, as we developed a habit of video chatting often. I got a job, and I felt truly happy. The person I was seeing then decided we should stop seeing each other due to feeling overwhelmed by their busy schedule. I work overnight and sleep during the day, so I probably have a Vitamin D deficiency now. And on top of that, I just got on birth control, so my hormones are all over the place. I hadn’t been outside in over three weeks until two days ago. Over the past month, I’ve just been sleeping, studying, and working. I’ve lost weight. I cry regularly. I’m easily irritable. I have lost interest in my hobbies. I feel like I can’t talk to my long distance friends anymore because I have no good news to share. I am usually a very social person, but I feel unmotivated to meet new people. I’m finally making an appointment with a therapist tomorrow, which I should have done months ago. I have hope that eventually things will get better. I know this is situational for me. I just want to feel like myself again soon.

"Called off work again. The job is easy and too slow sometimes which is why I called off. Most days I have almost nothing to do, but it so happens that the other person in charge of my task (higher up) called out again too.

I couldn't even enjoy my day off, and it seems to be the trend every single time I call off (at least 15 times in the last half year). 

This job pays better than a lot of jobs I could get with no degree, but the hour and a half drive is killing me. 3 hours if my day gone every single day. I'm stuck between going back to minimum wage and keeping this job.

If I stay, I can ride it out a little longer to pay off some debt. The problem is that I can't even show up consistently. I just want to run away from all my problems and enjoy time for myself but I can't even do that. 

I spent the 8 hours I would've spent working staying in my room and playing some MMOs. I binged watched anime to catch up and it all feels unsatisfying. I know I have to go back tomorrow and sell my time to pay some debt, and I don't know how I'll be able to get myself into a better job.

Im getting older and my problems are still the same as 10 years ago. No direction, no motivation, no consistency. What's wrong with me? Why am I failing myself every time. Why do I struggle to be consistent in whatever I aim for. If I could just do what I need to, I know I can make it, but I always hold myself back by running away from responsibility.

Sometimes I wish I can go back to when everything wasn’t fucked up, when I was in school having a blast everyday, spending my free days with my girl, someone who understood me for me but Bc I was childish and irrresponsible I pushed her away, I don’t think I’m ever going to find someone who loved me as much as she did, I’ve tried to date but it’s like no one actually connects with me they’re just interested in how I look outside they can’t look past the fact that we’re not even a good match together",Depressed
"So I fucked up what I had with this woman I’m talking to (or was). We hooked up one night and it was amazing. We had even planned to keep going til I left for school in a few months. It felt amazing to just hold someone in my arms for the first time in a long while. We had sex and then cuddled all night long. I found myself waking up a few times that night, and would just look at her in my arms, sleeping. It just felt amazing and I lost that little bit of human connection I felt I had with someone in a while.

But I fucked something up and she ended all that later that same day. I want to get over her, I really do but I can’t stop thinking about her. And I’m on a few dating apps, which suck. Thing is, I’m not even excited when I match with a girl, I just want to be with this woman. I felt content for the first time in a while. We have a great connection and can talk hours on end about lots of things. Idk, it just felt good to have that emotional and physical connection with the person I was with. But now we’ll never think of each other the same way ever again. 

After it happened, I had to go back and forth about whether or not I should keep talking to her. This was honestly the first friend I had made in at least a year and a half, so I didn’t want to lose that. But I feel really terrible because I still have these feelings for her. But I know after that one night, I’ll never be in that same content place for a long while. And again, she’s the only good friend i have, pretty much outside work. But I can’t talk to her about it, because all my thoughts are about her, and if I tell her my feelings about her, she’d probably send me away, telling me that I have to figure this all out before we could talk again. And we’d fuck up everything that we’d had before. 


We decided we’d stay friends (somehow) even after I leave for school. But then still being friends means I have to block all these other feelings I have for her. And even though we said we’d stay friends, and we’ve even seen each other since then (and it wasn’t weird), I’m still thinking about what could’ve been and I feel terrible because I don’t want to have these feelings. Because if I have these feelings, I can’t see her, and I feel lonely when I can’t see her. 

All in all, idk, I just feel conflicted inside my head, but I ultimately know how it’s gonna end, and it’s not how I’d like it to end. I’m trying to figure out words to describe what’s going through my head. Conflicted, isolated, and now lonely since I haven’t really seen or heard much since this all happened.

Sorry for the long post, had to let it out",Depressed
"I'm tired, mostly mentally. Sleep is still bad where I sleep during the day. I have even less motivation now than before. I can't bring myself to do the stuff I need to get done. On top of this I recently noticed I have dental issues. Have an appointment soon which I don't look forward to, but have to make it since the issues are causing pain and are likely to get worse the longer I wait.

Still feel empty in a way, very much indifferent as usual. I'm not sure what sucks more, the loneliness or the fact that I feel like I struggle with verbal communication due to having been socially isolated more than I've been social in the last decade.

I just want to go to sleep right now, to feel the comfort of the bed, but a small part of me knows that I need to stay awake to fix my sleep. Though another part don't see much point in it anymore since I do the same thing day in an day out, which is nothing, and it's not helping me at all. I don't have the will to do anything else. Sleeping seems like a good option.

I'm tired but too tired to do something about it, if that makes any sense. I don't want to die or be lonely anymore but I'm not sure if I have the will to live. I'm not even sure if I'm depressed anymore or if it's something else. I suffer from functional issues of the mental kind. I simply cannot bring myself to get anything done until it's absolutely necessary.

Of late I've thought about if it were better if I were a drone like many other people, just going about the day doing stuff and being somewhat productive as a result. At least things would get done that way. Made me think of certain illicit drugs like coke that'd make you goal oriented and help you feel good about doing literally anything. Though I have no interest in ruining my life further. Then I thought about if there are any legal drugs with similar effects.

Currently I really can't think of another way to motivate me to get things done, because I think that's where my problem lies. It's not that I lack the knowledge to improve my situation, but that I lack motivation, willpower and discipline. Things I've lost through years of constant decline in my mental well-being.

I want to be fixed but I don't know how one fixes a person that has stopped caring. Especially since caring is typically required to get things done. If you don't care then you really don't see a point in doing things. Everything for the most part is just devalued. This is where I feel I am at the moment.",Depressed

"So it was my sister's 30th birthday party on Saturday at my dad's bar. I was actually contemplating using the Coronavirus as an excuse to now show up but I knew that family I hadn't seen in ages would be there and it wouldn't be fair if I at least didn't show my face.

I stayed a lot longer than I was planning and at least they had live music so I was obviously enamored more with that than socializing, but it wouldn't do much good due to how loud it was and it frustrates me to no end trying to talk to someone and basically shout everything. Plus the volume did nothing to help my tinnitus. 

I know my ASD and general aloofness makes it tough for me in social situations, even with close family and I sometimes will not really think before I say something but one event that day really made me feel like crap and it's been weighing on my mind ever since. So naturally my dad asked me how I was while he was tending bar and without even thinking I went to my default saying and said ""Not dead yet!"" thinking I was trying to be funny cause I say it all the time. All he did was shake his head in a ""WTF?!"" gesture, smirked and then turned his back on me and refused to acknowledge me the rest of the time I was there; even when I said I was leaving he just smiled at me and didn't even say bye. 

I know it shouldn't bother me since I'm so used to this kind of thing between us but I'd be lying if I said it didn't hurt my feelings.

"Quarantine is making my depression so much worse... My whole routine is completely shaken up and I can’t do the things that keep me sane and happy. I hate being stuck at home with 2 horribly toxic people who abused me as a child and continue to abuse me. They’re the reason why I have CPTSD and I’m just feeling so much resentment right now. I don’t want to wait a month for this to be over, it’s only been 3 days of me being here and I already can’t take it anymore. I don’t know what else to do to make me feel better.

I log in, no one says anything. Maybe one or two says hi and then general silence. 
Someone else logs in, everyone from out of the wood work says hi, asking how their day is going. ""Wanna run dungeons?"" ""How about weekly raids?""

Idk why but to me that’s such a good feeling for me, I miss being able to be young and dumb and feel like the worst thing in the world is the hangover from a night before, but I’ve not resorted to numbing myself with excess drug use or “accidentally” taking that corner on the back roads too quick which resulted in me going through a barbed wire fence, driving thru a dam in which the fire brigade said I was lucky to even be alive, let alone injury free (other than a concussion).

Work, co-workers, friends, love life, strangers on the internet

Work: 
I have a rather new job and since day 1 I was always scared of losing it because the friends who used to work there said to me they were fired for nothing the job is at will so they can fire anyone at anytime, some even say if the boss doesn’t like you you’ll get fired. I’m walking on eggshells feels like I need the money to pay rent and school.
I feel like there’s no other jobs, or maybe I’m just too lazy to find another alternative it couldn’t be that bad, but I know this job means something to me and I would like to stay there till I finally get the career I want. Since day1 the manager never likes me. 
I even overheard her call me names like antisocial just because I am not talking to anyone, I feel like I don’t fit in their little groups and it’s really awkward to have this kind of close contact and very friendly relationship with your boss anyway but I must have came off as bitchy grouchy because I never say words. 
To be honest I’m just disappointed that the other job is not hiring me, but right now this is all I have at the moment I have stay here. 

Friends 
Thought my co worker is my friend, she was really friendly with me but there is a day when she doesn’t even talk to me but I have noticed on the days I talk to her she was so high energetic like what pills she take to make her that energetic. It is kind of scary. Because one day she is too talkative next day she completely ignores me makes me feel like what did I do wrong now? 
These past days she completely ignored me and it is time for bonus and I never get one because I’m not a favorite. 
I’ve been being put to different department to work while they hire more people in my department, I feel like I’m being auctioned and scared that next I’ll be fired just because the manager doesn’t like me. 
Coming back to co worker, once she completely ignored me I know she is avoiding me because she suck up to the manager she must have noticed the manager doesn’t like me and that is why she is avoiding me, which I understand now, and I have completely understand still breaks my heart the first day I noticed how she just completely stopped talking me to me this is probably why I have no friends, because you never know people thoroughly, and I understand my fault now, so it’s all right. 
This hurts because I told myself I love my job because I have friends, I thought I did and next morning she is ignoring me. 

Strangers on the internet
I have good news, but I became too cocky about it. I got a ticket to a concert that I love so much. I got the ticket and knew it is because of my hard work and dedication to this job. I feel like this job is giving me hard time and they do. But I am working hard so I can finally get to this concert. 
however other strangers on the internet upon telling them this good news, bashed me and called me obsessed. 
There were fans who go for the concert in many years which I cannot afford to do, and now I can afford due to my hard work sweat and blood and here strangers on the internet calling me insane obsessed creep because they couldn’t go to the concert.
I defend myself and told them to shut their mouths because they don’t know what they’re talking about. I admit I am obsessed because this artist is all I have. Going through so much depression and suicidal thoughts she is all that I have to think of to make me want to keep going in life and I did. And here I am with better paying job all because I knew how I wanted to finally afford this concert ticket.
I know I’m scared of my obsession but it is what is keeping me moving forward. 
I get so hard defending myself that I am normal that I have friends when I realized my co worker whom I thought was my friend wasn’t a friend after all. 
I feel like here I am, antisocial fucked up, maybe soon losing my job again unemployed loser. 
And have nothing going on in my life, not paying tax, sleeping dreaming all day long. 
I hate thinking of it. 
I think about it again, and the more when I think these strangers on the internet mock me for what is keeping me motivated that  I am insane, they are right I am insane and I’m friendless jobless, I am good for nothing. 
I want to jump in front of a train or go jump in the ravine so no one need to clean up after me. 
The more suicidal I feel which I haven’t feel in months.

No matter what I do, I cause problems and make people angry. I always feel like a nuisance and part of me wants to just start a new life elsewhere but I can’t afford to. I’ve been trying to sell some of my stuff but haven’t had much luck. 

My mother is a big issue. She loves to find something I’ve done wrong and speaks loudly so everyone can hear and input their opinions on whatever shit she makes up to be convenient. 

In short, I want to leave this place. However you wanna take that. I’m suicidal, and I’ve never been given the chance to get out of this shithole. I wanna live but not if I’m stuck with my verbally abusive parents.",Depressed

I actually don't mind Corona other than it making it harder to find jobs and the risk of contagion. It feels good that no one else is outside when I rarely go out. Like they're not getting ahead.

On top of this, I've had to completely cut off my extended family due to their toxicity and hypocrisy regarding my grandfather's death (and his general care in the 5 years leading up to his death due to his ever increasing dementia and the fact that his own children treated him like he was an unwanted toddler).

"Hello guys. I am sorry for bothering you again but I had a chain of events that drove me insane recently. I need help.

Let's start in chronological order.

0)As a prelude, isolation has worn down my mental health, I became angry and unstable. I like talking to people generally, usually it helps me with my depression. I am a pretty extroverted person.

1) Cut my own hair messily. It was falling on my eyes.

2) Some guy(we will call him A) messaged me that he apparently got a love confession from my girl friend (B). Which is very weird since I never saw B and A together, et cetera. 

3) I am Losing in a multiplayer strategy video game pretty badly, 11 hours worth of effort and cunning planning cast into the sea. I don't want my friends to restart the game because I'm trash at everything, either.

4) Previously mentioned friend (B) started acting weirdly. Sending me overly cloying messages (quarantine made my circle of friends only talk online. I think she might be hacked or something. Even her writing style seems kinda weird. I hate to assume and intervene in other people's private lives but something about her recent behaviour is off. Or maybe she is not hacked and it's just me overthinking and being mad everyone around me is in relationship and I am not able to attract anyone.

5) It became apparent that people notice what I, an idiot, did to my hair under stress of quarantine etc. and started commenting it. I am very insecure about my looks so it made me suffer a lot.

6)Woke up at 2 PM, sad and tired.

6) Went to the barber's to fix my hair, at least something is done.

7) Got reminded that I had previously had exchange spot in Romania with Erasmus scholarship NOT given to me. I am super insecure that I will never be able to study abroad. The general trend shows that I will not go anywhere. I will have an open gestalt, a scar to bear with me my whole life that I wanted to study abroad for a semester with scholarship but I never could not. I am not going to lie, I am pretty spiteful and jealous of the person who stole my place. I feel bad for saying this, but I hope something bad happens to her and she doesn't go anywhere. But yeah, mainly mad at myself.

My job (I teach English to grade schoolers) and university will resume in only a few days, but my mental health is so fragile I don't feel like I will manage.",Depressed

I am sad sure, but I am not falling apart currently. I am distancing myself. I am allowing myself to feel sad and cry because it is ok to and I deleted our conversation so I won't be compelled to talk to him first. I will still be friends, just need a short time to bring my interest down a bit.

Idk lately i feel like i might have depression, or maybe im jus temporarily depressed, but i fucking hate myself sometimes. Here are the reasons why:

1. I have a family who loves me and i love them too but maybe not as much as i should?? I mean like deep down i really love them but on the outside it seems like i want hardly anything to do with them. I never check in with my sisters (one of them has depression) and i dont even have the balls to tell my parents like a quick “Love you” as i leave, i always wait for them to say it then say “love you too”. I also never really have deep convos with my family, its more like small talk. Well sometimes we have deep convos but not as much as i see my friends do with their parents. My dad and I have this awkward relationship, more of like an uncle-nephew who arent really that close type relationship. I fucking hate it. And part of the reason that i dont change it is because i feel like i’ve waited too long and i am not the type of person to express or communicate my emotions (so thats why i’m typing this instead of telling my family). But also i feel like my dad and i dont have a strong relationship is because we are polar opposites; im more of a “popular” (i hate that term) kind of person but my dad would always tell me how he was a shy kid in school. Now my dad will stir up a convo with almost anybody about the most random shit, he loves talking, but i wont ever talk to a stranger unless they talk to me first. Anyways, regardless of how i treat my family, they always remind me about how much they care about me and love me, which makes me feel even more shitty because i feel like same way but havent showed them, maybe even shown them the opposite :(

2. I hate my appearance. For a little background my forehead looks like a butt lol but im not really insecure about that. Im more insecure about my protruding ears. Like if i were to have a buzzcut i’d look like a monkey. I sort of have a 2012 justin bieber cut (ik ik). Like my haircut fucking sucks but my hair is way too thin and straight to do anything else with it (ive tried putting gel in and it only works for like 30 minutes no matter how much i put in. And if i try blowdrying it back or something it always just falls forward again. I understand that i need to learn to accept myself for who i am and love the way i look, but thats a lot harder than it sounds when people are always making little jokes about it. Its not bullying, its more of like “friendly” teasing.

3.  I have a SUPER hard time finding motivation to do important things or things that challenge me. I’m lazy. Like earlier today i had an assignment due but i didnt do it because it was wayyyyy too much work. I do care about my grades a lot but i when i look at them and get disappointed, i dont try to change them by trying harder, i just loath and get sad about how bad they are. I fucking hate how i do that and i dont know why i do. i also can never seem to be able to push myself hard enough to do things that challenge me. Mainly things i just dont enjoy doing, like schoolwork. But when im working out or running, whenever i feel like cheating a rep or cutting the run short i always say this quote to myself: “A moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory”- Unbroken. 

I started typing this at 4:00 am, its now currently 4:42 am (i cant fucking sleep) because it took me that long to put what i have been thinking to myself for the past couple months into words that sound like they make sense. For anyone who read this whole thing, thank you sooooo much for your time and if you have any advice at all, ANYTHING, please tell me. Im tired of living like this.",Depressed

But I'd like to pretend that I haven't spent all this time just seeking out dopamine and wasting time. That I'm a person who had his life together yesterday and for the past few years.

" I don't know if it's alright for me to put this here, but I've been trapped with this for so long and need to put it out somewhere. 
 I've suffered through depression for most of my life, I don't know how to describe it, it comes and goes. Well about a year and a half ago it came and never left.
It cost me everything I loved and believed in. My home, my job, my dog, and the person I loved.
Looking back alot of people thought I was depressed and suicidal because we broke up, but I was that way well before we broke up, it was part of the reason we did. I know it's not okay to put all of that on someone to say they are your reason to stay and hang on.
I'm actually glad we broke up, looking back I wasn't good for her. She deserved someone who wasn't a curse. Looking back I see all the damage I caused and am happy to see that she's doing a lot better to be with someone that can make her happy and not cause pain.
I think I finally understand what she meant when she said she was scared of me. She was the only person who truly saw me under all the layers, and what she saw scared her enough to put up walls and run.
And I think I finally see what she saw, a curse of a person. A plant that was grown in bad soil and when moved elsewhere it polluted the soil around it.
Looking back at my life I think I might be a curse upon others. I see all the damage I caused by just being around and this depression was meant to keep me away from others and not cause more pain than i already do. 
I don't know anymore I've got this voice trapped in my head and im just a mess that causes problems.
And I just don't know, I've been to the doctors, been to therapy, been on meds.
I'm 26 and just don't know why I try anymore. I'm stuck between feeling empty and alone and hating myself. Of wanting somewhere someone there in the dark to hold me while I cry and tell me it'll be okay. Of hating myself for feeling weak for wanting someone there but being told you shouldn't depend on others and you should love yourself. But I don't know how to love myself, all I feel is a deep hatred for myself and don't know if I ever could love myself and that no one deserves to be stuck with someone like that. 
I'm sorry for the long and jumbled rant, I just needed to put this out somewhere after keeping it locked up for so long.",Depressed
"Day 6 post breakup, this day sucked because he kept popping into my head and I kept trying to pinpoint which moments were turning points and I also tried to figure out what he meant when he said some things and what kind of person he’s going to date next and if that’s going to be his perfect person and if he’s going to be successful in the future and if he’ll feel pain or regret when he’s reminded of me because right now I want him to. I still feel like I wasted my time and I still have never felt so unlovable, pathetic, and stupid. I opened up to him so much and I felt like he closed me like a book he finished reading. I read posts from people that said they’re still not over their ex even after several months. I really don’t want this to be me but he was my everything and I called him my other half. I couldn’t focus at all today.",Depressed

I just want to scream at them to address their issues and work it out but I can’t. And now I feel like even more shit because I feel like it’s my fault about it all even though I know I’ve been good and trying hard and I’m pretty sure it’s just a worse fight. Like the quarantine is getting to us but like I still feel really sad.
I guess it’s not extreme depression or anything but I’ve been really sad a while now and I don’t know where else to post",Depressed

I'm beginning to lose touch with myself. Feels like I'm getting closer and closer to watching my life rather than living it. I've managed just over a month sober and in that time I've realised why I was using in the first place. I can't face who I am. I can't live a life where I can't connect with people. I can't watch my friends and family grow up around me and live happy lives while I can't even manage to keep a couple friendships. I feel emotionally paralysed. Like a sun with no shine. It doesn't matter what I do or how I feel I just can't seem to become close with anyone. I feel so alone. I've just bought some more drugs to hold me over until I have my phone assessment. I said I wouldn't kill myself until I give mental health support services a good go. If it doesn't work I guess I know what I'm doing next.,Depressed

For some reason I used to be okay with being alone and at home, but now I really want to go outside and see the nature. I also can't stop wanting to talk to this one guy who's my friend and I don't want to talk to anyone else. 

I exercise daily but today i ate badly and just want to go on a walk but I'm not allowed to anymore and I'm suffocating in here. I need something positive and I have no idea why suddenly I'm so sad but I really need to go on a walk or run to clear my thoughts. I'm dying mentally and I can't do this anymore.",Depressed
I gave myself a concussion during a mental breakdown the other night. Freaked out and just wanted the noise to stop so I started hitting myself in the head as hard as I could. Feel like nothing is ever gonna be worth what I put into it. I’m also still stuck with hours of school work a day for an art degree right before the onset of the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression. I just want to go back in time. Feels unfair that I have so many mental health problems and on top of that I’m living in one of the worst eras ever. Feels like every year the world becomes worse. Just want to feel like there will be a spot for people like me after this but there wasn’t even a spot before. Can’t go back to shitty minimum wage retail I just can’t.,Depressed

I looked at his socials to try and see what he was doing, and I even looked at his summoner game history😣. I wanted to message him really badly so again I messaged his discord account that he doesn’t use anymore. Instead of telling him that I missed him I listed several instances in the relationship when I felt unloved, lonely or pathetic. I was surprised at how many I could think of in my head. I stopped after 13 because I felt exhausted from reliving all of those moments. I watched a YouTube video on how dumpers feel after a breakup because I just really wanted to know how he was doing but I had to maintain no contact. If the videos are accurate then that should be enough closure for me. A pattern I’m noticing is that my mood is great in the mornings, super terrible in the middle of the day, and random in the night.

I think I’m now deciding against it because it seems to me as if it would help him get closure faster and feel less guilty about breaking up with me. I’ve had my suspicions that the reason he wanted a friendship after this was just so he would feel less guilty and while that sounds like a harsh judgement on his character, I can’t help but come to that conclusion after reflecting on his actions throughout the relationship and leading to the breakup. I put my all into us and now I’m left with having to find closure from within myself so I feel he needs to do that as well.

Now, everyone else in the world is feeling anxious and concerned about our unpredictable future. ...but I feel the same. ""Happy,"" as normal people would describe it? I went grocery shopping yesterday and everyone's vibes we're starting to give me anxiety, but I dealt with it. I pushed through, and my therapist is going to feel proud when I tell her. 
My bubble of the world is doing kinda ok, but I want to feel bad, scared, and anxious for everyone else.

"Day 14 post breakup. Today was really depressing. I cried a couple times when thinking about him. I’m thinking about how he’ll be in grad school next semester and will be too busy to even remember me. I’m thinking about how I’m supposed to use this time for growth but the truth is I’ve tried so hard at life and so many things have failed and after my relationship failed, I just feel like a failure magnet with no growth potential. I’m living with my broken family where no one talks to each other, I’m unable to do my schoolwork/resumé projects after being broken up with, but I need a job and I need to start making money fast so I can just move out, fuck off, and try to live some kind of fulfilling life. I’m feeling a little empty and hopeless tonight. I think the “good” I felt that day when he messaged me something random was actually me power tripping. I just feel really sorry for myself tonight. Sorry for everything I failed, sorry for my circumstances, and sorry for all the times I felt unloved by this one guy, yet still continued to love back and make a priority. I can’t stop crying",Depressed

"Yeah. I’m pretty much fucked. Bullying trauma is a bitch to handle. Just had a nice moment of yelling and moaning and groawling. Its fucked when you have a nervous breakdown and the rug gets pulled from below. Next thing you know you are general anxiety with moments of crazy where nervous energy gets discharged, which is great but it all seems bizarre and unreal. My supposedly best friend only knows to say “accept” and its not that bad advice but I wish more, some sympathy and all that. Did some stupid things that cost me money because of spur of the moments brain farts. And all that sucks. Sucks not to think straight, when you know you should know better. Sucks to be a silent mental patient that never got well because other people forgot. And i did not remember in time and in force and in good judgement.",Depressed

"I've been reading through eating disorder subs because I know someone who has one and I'm sending her memes. It's such a unique experience. Always counting calories, reading up nutrients, having binge purge cycles. There are so many numbers and calculations being involved. I was thinking about my own social anxiety but in the end there's just no comparison possible. 

I have no idea about ed but I feel like in the end you still have a ""goal"" (which might be unhealthy though) and you're doing something for it (even though this might be unhealthy). But you're still proactive and I think that's... at least something? 

With social anxiety it often feels like there is no 'goal', you're just trying to avoid even more people and situations and it ruins your life. Having no spine, having no social skills. Being obsessed what your therapist could be thinking about you, hoping they have a good opinion of you (like that matters). Being unable to make phone calls, or read emails. Not being able to buy groceries or use public transport. 

I've been doing so much completely deranged stuff while either not noticing or not being able to do something about it. All of this is also the reason I usually don't expect others to understand. Which is also why I don't expect that person I know to understand. 

Edit: I also feel like many people with ed are quite high functioning, like she is as well. Not sure if this increases the distance between us.",Depressed

I could walk around my house, but my complex is right across from a much richer neighborhood. Only place around to walk and I hate walking there because I just feel like I don't belong there and I get awkward, uncomfortable and sad. I can't exercise and I can't stop eating. I hate it.

People I used to respect are spewing vile and harmful opinions and that hurts me more than I thought it could. I want to believe that people are inherently good, and I've been able to maintain that illusion by just avoiding people, but now I can't get away from them. Yes, I know that's ironic. All anyone can talk about is Covid-19, and that inevitably leads back to politics, and I can't handle it. I want my illusion back.",Depressed

Sometimes I think about maths and something like exponents.

"I’m 27. I have dealt with severe depression in the past on the brink of suicide. Because of God I was set free. I was doing great until recently. Because of the whole quarantine and corona it has me spending a lot of time with my family. All members of my family have strong personalities... and then there’s me a quiet, introverted, quiet, low self esteem guy. I feel like I do not belong in this family. I don’t fit in. My dad for example my dad told me the other day “You are not normal. You have to be normal. tell yourself everyday your normal.” I actually pray everyday that I get cancer or corona because I do not want to live anymore and I know my family will be better off and so will I. I saw the movie “Seven Pounds” today and in the movie Will Smith takes his own life by letting a poisonous jellyfish sting him while in the bath tub. I am currently trying to figure out how to acquire that jellyfish. My family always tells stories of family trips we took and they always forget I was there. They even say “Oh yeah I forgot you were there. I thought you weren’t”. i’m done living and just want to go. Everyday I wake up i’m like “please lord just take me already”. I would take my own life but i would want to do it in a clean way if that makes sense and i think the jellyfish would come in handy. I feel like Im a burden and a worry and stay in my room as much as possible to try to not bother or annoy anyone. I’m weird and way different than my family. I cannot be myself around my family because they are quick to judge. That’s why I want to go because I can finally be at peace. I always have to be on guard around my family because if not then I will be judged and questioned and it’s just too much to handle. Hopefully one day I’ll be gone and everyone including me will be happier and it’ll be one less burden and worry for me and my family. I know the world will be a better place if i was gone. In the meantime I just try to survive each day as best as possible. The only thing keeping me sane is playing video games. My family doesn’t notice if i’m here or not so it won’t make much of a difference if i was gone. If there was a service where you can hire a hitman i’d do that but in the meantime i hope i can leave this life soon. Btw i have no friends except one so most of the day i talk to myself, pray, watch tiktok, and play video games. No one understands me or tries to they just judge and belittle me making me feel even worse. I wish I had someone to relate and talk to but in the meantime my stuffed animal monkey will do. If anyone knows a hitman let me know or of a quick and easy way to kill yourself please let me know. God bless you all",Depressed
I felt so bad today that I couldn’t even bring myself to cry. I’ve lost six pounds because I lost my appetite and I just can’t bring myself to explain it to my family other than I’m just not hungry. I have this sense of impending doom and I know that makes sense with the whole virus situation but I can’t even say I really place the blame on the virus itself specifically.

I don’t deserve anything I have yet everyone’s gonna judge me if I give it up. My boyfriend shat on me last night because I can’t see what good I have in my life. I don’t deserve any of this. I don’t deserve him. I’m not the right person to be thrust with all these resources and privileges. I’m too weak to do anything right. He wants me to fix my mindset. I couldn’t bring myself to ask him: what am I supposed to do when I have no control of my mind anymore?

This haunts me. I’m tired of trying to convince myself that I’m worth struggling through all this pain. It’s so trivial, all of this. Yet why am I hurting so much? I have no clue. Maybe I’m weak, that’s why. So many people have it worse than me. I understand my feelings are valid, but it doesn’t mean they’re justified. 
I’m so selfish.

Why try if I know I’m beyond help? Do I even have the potential to get better? What use can I be if I’m still trying to break free from whatever pain my shithole head has created? Is it all that I am? A walking burden?

My depression is not being helped by my isolation due to quarantine and I'm worried that it's just going to keep getting worse. Also, I have stopped taking my zoloft for no reason other than that I cant motivate myself to open a new prescription bottle. It's been about 5 days since I last took it. 

I think what really pushed me over the edge today was getting a message from a former friend who all of a sudden decided to tell me that I've wronged her beyond forgiveness for a genuine mistake I made 6 months ago. She literally hadn't talked to me since this semester began and then out of the blue sent this to me, while I had no idea it was even still an issue. So I'm feeling like a total piece of shit seconds away from just deleting all of my social media and cutting off my nonessential contacts. It's so easy for me to go from loving my friends to feeling like relationships are an inconvenience. Anyway. I'll try to take my medication tomorrow.",Depressed

And I’ve been on a relapse with an addiction (not drug related lol) and it’s hurt my family prior, imagine after swearing it off telling your family you’ve gone back? I just want to end it all right now; I don’t feel any type of meaning, especially when I’ve seen the way people look at me in disgust. I don’t have any friends. I’m lost, scared and alone.

I think this was healthier than angry pacing, but it's still a furnace blazing away in my chest, electricity coursing through my veins.

Sometimes I thought it was just laziness so I pushed forward, but more and more I feel like I genuinely just changed when I was a teenager and flat-out lost interest, and that no amount of forcing myself will make me like it anymore. 

Only reason I don't stop, I guess, is I don't know what else to do. I have to get out of this computer-type career somehow, but so far every other interest is as bad as programming. I just don't like creating or making anything so far. I don't know how creative people are able to actually want to make things.",Depressed
"Idk if this fits here but I’m at an point where I’m not feeling anything but sadness. Not the “something bad just happened”-sadness but just overall sad feeling. The last few months have been a total down. End of last year , I failed school and was forced to drop out. But that was alright because I’ve found a full time job right after , that has been keeping me busy at least 12 hours a day. I went to the gym every morning before going to work. All of that kept me somewhat happy. But in this quarantine that sad feeling has gotten the worst it has ever been. I don’t even enjoy video games anymore. Books and movies don’t interest me at all. Nothing. So I’m at my apartment quarantined with my mother who was visiting just as the lockdown occurred. We have never been close. She was a bad mother and we’ve had our ups&downs because of that but nevertheless I can’t stand her for more than a few minutes. The last few days have been especially hard. I almost cried even for no particular reason just felt like it. The last time I cried was back in 8th Grade wenn I got kicked out on the street the first time. Didn’t cry since then. I’m now in my early 20s. I have nothing worth living for at the moment and every day just drags itself",Depressed

All these things gave me purpose and structure and they are all gone and I really want to do the things I should be doing but I just don’t see the point so I spend all day doing all the wrong things for my life and for my body and feeling like shit but not being motivated to do the things I should be because I feel no purpose or worth to my life or existence.",Depressed

"Day 33 post breakup. I think last week when I said I was going to stop writing updates for a bit, I must’ve just had a good week. Because I’ve had not so good days in the past few days and right now I’m having trouble focusing on my work because I’m sad. So I forced myself to take this time to sit here and write so I can figure out why I’m feeling sad because I couldn’t figure it out right away like I have been recently. I’ll likely go back to a daily commitment. 

I think I’m just missing the good times. Recently I’ve had a lot of flashbacks to the first year where everything was sweet and new. There were even flashbacks of times I forgot existed...why did those decide to just come out now? Then I had flashbacks to moments of this past year where sometimes it was warm and light. There was a silly thing we would do where we would pretend we were about to fight each other video game style. For some reason it would always devolve into us pretending like we were a devilish pair of chihuahuas flashing their teeth at each other before the violent biting would occur, while still keeping our fighting stances up. He would say so many times while laughing “what would other people think if they saw us right now?” I hate that it’s a possibility that the burden of subconsciously keeping all these memories alive is only on me, because he is a rather forgetful person on details.

I could also be sad because of the knowledge that he just recently moved out of his apartment. Okay acknowledging this has started the crying so I think this is the issue. He’s going to grad school next semester far away and I’ll be tackling on one more semester at the same school. I have already pictured the sadness or longing I’ll feel when I pass by his campus apartment or the grocery store we always went to together. Or the buildings we explored together or the path I know he always took with his bike on his way to class. Or his department’s building. I’m going to pass by his old dorm room where we first kissed. I’m plagued with the fear that I’m going to be lonely and stuck with this longing that the now-vacated places and things I associated with him will be restored by him somehow. Like some kind of ghost. Because of my terrible mistake of committing to him more than school I’m afraid I’ll never get a chance to be successful, move out of my damaged home, and actually start my own life. Lastly I’m devastated that all the effort I put in was all meant to simply be a lesson for him in the end to be better for his next partner. I know I am more than a lesson or a mistake or a regret yet that’s how i feel today. I have no meaning besides being a lesson for someone to be better for someone else and being an example of what not to do in college.",Depressed
"i'm currently in a terrible state of not knowing how to proceed from here and guilt that i'm thinking so so many terrible thoughts. i'm currently jobless. i've been on short-term disability for a few months to help cope with everything, but that hasn't worked. i'm just not going to extend it because the entire process feels overwhelming.

i got with a girl when i was working from my work, who was unhappy in her marriage, was working on leaving him. she ended up leaving him, eventually we moved in together. then, a lot of other shit came up. she moved back in with him and.. hasn't really been back since. well, she's pregnant. with my kid.. i just found out it's a boy. i should be so excited, but for the last several months, i just can't get past the idea that.. i'm never going to truly feel like this kid's dad. i'm not going to be there for the little things. i'm going to be present... if i make it that long.. but we aren't going to be a family. and that's all i ever wanted. and inside, that's killing me.

now, the one person that i could really talk to about this stuff, we can't talk anymore for one reason or another. so now, i'm just feeling incredibly alone. i'm feeling like there's really no point in anything.

I've wasted so much time sitting around thinking about shooting myself. I'm not gonna damn shoot myself. I would've done it by now. All this pain is because I spend so much time in my own head, feeding my worthless ego. It's pointless. It's time to get out and look beyond myself. Focus on others, develop meaningful relationships with people. Take the bad things in stride and not dwell on them, because there's no point in it. It doesn't matter.

"It's strange. I've been living in a government assisted housing thing since December and I guess I've technically been doing better since then (couple of years of depression that rendered me unable to work or study before that, probably more depression prior to that too).

I even got in to a school that I've been applying for for four years. Today it just kinda hit me that nothing really changed as a result of it. I still ultimately feel shit and empty and I still think about killing myself almost every day. I know where and how too.

Ultimately in a spurt of true depressive grandeur I end up being too lazy or tired to actually go through with it. Given how often I think about trying to stab myself - or otherwise bleed myself out to death - but end up not doing anything about since its such an effort and so ineffective, I think that I'd probably be long dead if I had access to handguns in this country.

I'm like a little depressed LEAN-practitioner. Except I depress-eat too much to really warrant any kind of skinny-aligned verdict on my body type anymore.

I have a really good support system that I treat like dirt and I'm aware of it. Cue the ""I don't deserve my friends, but I'd also make them sad if I offend myself"" (which is real and valid if you're not me, btw)

"My ex-gf (of 4 years), who is still my closest confidante and roommate, has been diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She's backed out of all the plans we had together, such as getting a house to eventually turn into an Air BnB (we had enough for down payment). She's now gonna be moving with her mom, then likely moving in with her new boyfriend after (depending on recovery)... They both live out of town, so I'll likely never see her again when she leaves at the end of the month, and since I live very far away from family, I'm going to be alone and living in poverty for the foreseeable future.

I understand why she's changing her priorities, but it still kills me inside. Between her diagnosis shattering our dreams, her new relationship, and then some really insensitive remarks my brother made when I told him about everything, I'm now a walking bomb. 

Never did anything like this before, but this morning, I raged so hard that I ended up making a giant hole in my bedroom wall. I covered it up with a giant Zebra portrait I have, but there's dry wall dust everywhere, and my computer chair is now unusable.

I just had to break it to my partner that I am not able to come to Chicago in the coming months, I financially can't afford it as I don't qualify for unemployment, and as I'm in a high-risk group, I should not be in Chicago regardless. Luckily we are able to see each other in a couple weeks, but that's the first time in a couple months, and going this long has already proved fucking hard, and even this is being irresponsible in doing so. And she is expecting even more activity being done via Skype and whatnot in the future, and I've already been putting max output into this and neglecting friends, spending hours on the phone each day, helping her research for a class assignment that she hasn't had the time to complete (she works full-time while also going to school full-time), and trying to help her maintain a positive outlook through all this shit. She doesn't have it easy by any stretch, and her depression/anxiety has been exacerbated by all this. But I don't know how much more I can feasibly do, as my mental health (major depression and gad) has been in the shitter ever since covid started, and she hasn't had the means to pursue treatment.

I've been fortunate enough to be able to weather this out with my family, but that's been a stressor as well as my parents and I don't have the greatest relationship and I've been trying to mitigate between my brother and my parents, who clash frequently. Plus I've been trying to maintain my dry streak, as alcohol has proved a problem in the past, as I have the tendency to drink my problems.

I'm 22, but have only been for about a month. And I'm feeling the age gap with my partner (she's 24), but this whole situation has been fucked. I can't end this as I am a major support pillar for her right now, and I can't pull that out from under her. But I also want to make this work ideally, but I'm not sure if I'm mentally able to. I've been trying not to use substances, not to slip back into old patterns of self-harm, been back to having semi-regular panic attacks, and been really struggling with controlling my depression.

Knowing that there's too many unknowns and not having an end date to this situation is throwing me off my goals and methods to keep me sane, now all I could think of is what's the point. I feel like a machine just working with no end goal and just want to tap out of life. Nothing is enjoyable anymore. I've tried meditating and yoga which makes me feel great in the morning but the minute I start working and hearing the huffing and the puffing (we live in a 1bedroom loft, no walls to separate anything), I feel helpless and hopeless. Yes, we're better off than many people during this weird time but it doesn't change how I feel about myself and my value in this world.

"Day 44 post breakup. Today was a really stressful day but I finally turned in my semester project. Tomorrow (I guess I should say today) is going to be a huge test of emotional strength when I attempt to move out of my college apartment. The deadline is by noon that day and the reason I had not been able to move out earlier was because I was working my ass off for a strong finish to my second to last semester at college and because I had to work on my project. I am super anxious about this but it is something that has to happen anyway. I am not conveying much anxiety through my words but I’m definitely feeling lots of it right now. Some of his things are still there and I can already feel the heartbreak that is going to come with sifting through everything. He broke up with me before quarantine happened and then he moved out before I did so it really feels like I am picking up the remaining pieces. Can someone please keep me in their thoughts tomorrow 😔

These two events (project and move-out) have been the source of my bad days and have been the catalysts for my self loathing and extreme desire to reach out to him so I am just hoping for a miracle in this healing process and that completing this move out will be the catalyst for me finally moving on.

"Feeling super depressed which isn’t something new, the guy I’ve been with for three years is also being extra rude and doesn’t wanna be together not the first time he has said this. We took a break got back together and he spent all his time with his friends we never had alone time or never wanted to spend time with me at all. I’m just feeling like complete shit, that I’m never good enough for anyone. I was thinking back to all the people I’ve been with and they all have cheated on me in someway. So is their something wrong with me?! Am I not worth fighting for. 

 Back story with the guy I’m with currently I was in a previous relationship before him with a guy I had known since middle school we broke up, he wanted to spend time with my kids I said sure we met for lunch I had two glasses of wine an hour prior to meeting for lunch met at a Mexican restaurant and had a margarita, went to the bathroom with my daughter was in there about ten minutes than Finishes drink and left, on the way to drop the kids off at his place I started to feel weird I get there start to get super tired I fell asleep and he raped me took pictures of me than was messaging me the next day saying I am pregnant and that he isn’t gonna let another man raise his kid I was on my period when he raped me I got my kids and left went to the hospital and filed a report. I had just started seeing the guy I am with and had to tell him what happened. He says I cheated on him but I was raped. We still stayed together but nothing in our relationship has gotten better, it’s gotten worse since moving into the house he bought and him always spending time with his roommates. I think he just won’t love me or try to because of that incident which I felt like shit about, I felt degraded, and so horrible for hurting him because even though we just started dating I loved him and thought he was the one for me. I don’t know what to do to make anything better. 

I feel so lonely sad and been crying all day because I feel like a horrible person that no one will ever ever love

I think men need it and crave it so much more and we women have to deal with a lot of other things so sex isn’t always on our mind. After having kids it changes women too I’m sure.

I get that it's kinda weird to have an AmA because personally, the internet won't be one of the place I'll visit when I want to end it all.. but still.. all those hateful and ignorance directed at you, is exactly why I'm afraid to disclose to people irl that I'm depressed and suicidal.. It'll be like the trigger for me to really end it all when I'm here still trying to hold on.. 

I've had my lessons when I disclose my mental illness (complete with hospital test results, doctor statements and psychologist analysis) to my family members, one of them said ""suicide is for losers"", another keep denying it and act like I just made it up, while the other one spreads about it to their friends ""See, what did I told you? OP has no friends and have negative mindset. Turns out OP is depressed. I proved my point that OP is a horrible person to be with"". There's no sympathy let alone empathy at all.. it's like my mental illness is just another piece of gossip for them.

I needed to resit my exams because I failed one of my subjects and the other subject I didn't get a good enough grade so I am also older than everyone in my year and I feel alienated.

"It's hard. This will pass eventually. You recognized beauty and it touched you. We can get through this. My depression is really bad too. I had been bad about self, - isolating and now it's not a choice. I have been reaching out to friends and having dinner over video and it helps. We have to find ways to connect with others and you are doing that by posting this.

My parents aren't into video calls but I tell them I need them. It makes me happy to see them.

I know it can be hard to see it, but there is still such beauty to look forward to in the future. Years ago I drove to Colorado for the first time. I had never spent time there. When I was leaving New Mexico, and I saw the Rocky Mountains in person for the first time, it absolutely took my breath away.  

I thought to myself, I need to always remember this feeling when my depression is bad. There is nothing like the excitement of experiencing something amazing for the first time. I hang on to that so I can remember that there is still so much left to do.",Depressed
Animal Crossing has been helping me as well. The way the animals talk and make no sense just makes some part of me light up. The game is amazing and I’m glad that playing it has helped you.,Depressed
I can relate. I’ve been so unstable recently but every time a villager smiles when they see me or sings I get emotional. My favorite villager poncho calls me “lil bear” and it’s the best thing,Depressed
"I did the same a few years ago with a pokemon game. Looking back at my gym badges, each one had a little inspirational blurb from the leader I got it from. One of them was from a young girl and it said ""I'll never forget you, ever!"". Maybe one day I'll understand why that hit me so hard.",Depressed
"I feel this post in my bones haha. I got Animal Crossing on launch day for the same reasons. My first emotional reaction was when I got stung for the first time, and Diva gave me a recipe for medicine to make it better. The second one was when I got all 10 of my villagers, and I realized I could never let any of them go because they all feel like friends lol

I’m a 28 year old dude who got fucked over by my roommate, had to leave my job, and move back to NY with my parents for now. Once the virus came through, it all but ended my job search for the time being. So Animal Crossing has been my therapy session through all of this lol

Sorry you’re going through all this, but thank you for making this post and sharing how you feel with us. I hope the sun starts shining in both of our lives someday. :)",Depressed
I hope things get better for you 🥺 May God we with you during your tough time,Depressed
"I can relate almost. One song made me cry because it reminded me that I won’t be happy soon and I just want to say, please push yourself. I’m cheering for you.",Depressed
"It's been difficult. I recently started going back to school and was very excited to be in that type of environment all over again, and this quarantine has really fucked me over. Panic attack count through the roof.

&#x200B;

its okay though, we'll get through this, this will pass and things will go back to normal soon.",Depressed
"the moment i lost my girlfriend, everything is never the same. each day gets worse day by day. it's been 3 years already and i've never recovered. hope you don't end up like me.",Depressed
Reading this almost made me want to cry. I am so sorry for what you're going through. I never comment on posts and this is my first time doing so. Been dealing with depression for almost 9 years and I know it's hard to believe but things will get better. Medication and therapy helped me. I know you can get through this. ❤,Depressed
"Animal crossing made me cry a couple times for similar reasons.  Usually it’s because a villager will write an overwhelming adorable and sweet card or say something that’s just good to hear but that people don’t tend to say.  It’s an amazing game for sure, but definitely does highlight how far behind I’ve allowed myself to get when it comes to mental health.  I hope things get better for you soon",Depressed
i really want to play that game but animal crossing always reminds me of my ex,Depressed
I feel that. When my villagers do cute things or wear my designs I get so soft 🥺sending good vibes!,Depressed
Aw babe I’m the same and I appreciate my little villagers very much. If you wanna swap gifts and stuff lmk you can add me on ANC! 💖,Depressed
Same,Depressed
"Know the feeling. I've recently cried over a fanfiction because a moment was so beautiful... but I'm glad I did, because I've been bottling up emotions for a month and finally breaking and crying released all of it and told someone about my issues shortly after. 

Hang in there, the lockdown is slowly lifted in one country after another. We will soon go back to normal.",Depressed
"Naw you sound like such a sweet person! I’m glad you’re taking some control over your depression by finding an outlet for it such as AC. 

Although I’m not sure what you’re exactly going through as I’m not in your shoes however, hang in there - life definitely gets better love! :)",Depressed
Meanwhile my depression is keeping me from playing Animal Crossing or any video games.,Depressed
"I’ve been depressed for years and I’m not gonna lie, some of these days I wished for rona to end it all for me, although I feel pretty guilty thinking of all the people who have it and are fighting for their life, but yesterday and today I actually have trouble breathing but not other symptoms so far, maybe are allergies I can’t go to the hospital because the risk of getting it, and I feel pretty chill, I only regret the mess my house is in and the one who will have to clean it if anything happened to me, isolation is a bitch",Depressed
"I understand what you mean
Only seeing moments of tenderness and love make me long for everything I don't have and don't see having in the future.",Depressed
"I can relate! :( Have you listened to the animals sing Bubble Gum KK? ""Oh, bubblegum dear, why are you crying?"" I didn't expect the song to have an actual meaning so when I read the lyrics, it made me tear up because I was so depressed and alone when I'd first heard it.",Depressed
i feel you. wish i had a switch tho,Depressed
"You wanna talk, bud?",Depressed
This makes me feel better. I find some of the things they do make me a little emotional too. Other people do not see the charm in the game but I love it. Find the happiness where you can. That's what I do to get through the days.,Depressed
This happened to me when I watched Avengers Endgame for the first time earlier in quarantine. That fucking Steve and Peggy scene at the end made me cry really hard (like too hard) because of how sweet and happy it was and it made me realize how depressed I am.,Depressed
What is this thing you call 'friends' ?,Depressed
"You know, I had the same kinda feeling with every dog in a video game. They make me feel that I'm free form depression and suffering.

Examples include: Petting Buckley in last of us, freeing Boomer in Far Cry 5, interacting with any dog in RDR2.

Animal crossing is a nice game, sadly I don't have a Switch",Depressed
"I had a very similar experience!! 2 of my villagers started singing and I just had the overwhelming urge to cry, just because it made me so happy while all sorts of shit has been going on. You’re not alone! Hopefully animal crossing continues to bring you happiness !",Depressed
"Haha that does sound really cute, I havn't touched it in weeks but now I want to go back and collect all the cute villagers. There's a sheep I want.",Depressed
"Thank you for sharing. I understand how tough it is. I had a similar experience during my birthday. I was alone in my apartment. It was dark and i felt super lonely. I decided to pick up my 3DS to play Pokemon Sun. I went to the pokemon center. The screen dimmed and there were confetti and the pokemon center jingle change to a birthday theme. I actually forgot it was my birthday and I cried when the in game text said happy birthday to me. It was the only time when a NPC said happy birthday and when I cried during a game. Depression sucks and I wish I could just beat it up and throw it out of my mind. AC has also help with my depression and I think buying my switch is one of the best investments I ever made. Sorry, I noticed I rambled lol",Depressed
"I just calm my rage by killing demons in Doom eternal. Try it out if you got the specs, a really good game.",Depressed
"I was so so so excited for this game for the longest time .. it felt like it was the only thing I was looking forward to .. but tbh I’m feeling so depressed right now, haven’t picked up the Nintendo in a week and there seems nothing that makes me happy anymore .. not even this precious game ugh idk what it is.",Depressed
"Be grateful. Tears of being Alive

I have no emotions. Due to ssri medication.",Depressed
"OP, I’m in the similar boat with my situation, except mine is milder. Bc I’m stuck in my apartment 99% of the time (plus dealing with my roommate’s weird bullshits) and can’t work since i will start my full-time right after July 4th, I felt like I was useless and has to live with my parents’ allowances again until I get my first big girl’s paycheck. I was fortunate that my bf is very supportive and understanding what I’m going through right now.

We’re in this together, and there’s a light at the end of the tunnel (quarantine will be over sooner than you think, also depending on where you live and the recovering phases). 

Animal Crossing has been really helpful for me to feel like I accomplished something, like redesigning island and moving my villagers around a little bit. Plus, villagers are so cute when they’re singing (I even had Marina threw tamper tantrum one time bc one of my villagers spoiled her book’s ending lol). Also, feel free to play with me bc I also look for more AC friends to play with :)",Depressed
"don’t worry dude, i play a lot of pocket camp since i can’t really afford anything else and daisy always seems to want to play the trombone at my campsite and i seem to well up whenever she plays with zell or any other villager.",Depressed
"I've been using animal crossing as a coping mechanism too. I'm an essential worker with depression and anxiety. I was actually able to see people until yesterday but I started showing symptoms of the virus, and I get the test less than 4 hours from now. I was told regardless of the results I still need to self-quarantine for at least 10 days, so I guess my villagers are gonna be my bffs for right now.",Depressed
"I love you buddy, please stay strong",Depressed
I recently started playing animal crossing for the gamecube in hopes it will calm me down from being depressed and after 3 months of playing my memory card broke by accidently stepping on it :(,Depressed
" It's very sweet you cried at the singing. Sometimes music moves us deeply, and reminds us there is Beauty out there. I hope you get well soon.",Depressed
I love how cute that game is. The singing is my favorite part but when they get all excited to show you new things or when they do the airplane circle thing it's so precious.,Depressed
I’m happy that AC is helping you. I have also found it to be helpful. The villagers are always so sweet and loving. Helps me feel less alone and to escape reality and be on the wonderful island.,Depressed
"Animal crossing has really helped me, gives me a reason to wake up, and something to look forward too. The island has given me purpose and friendship.",Depressed
"At my worst, I can relate as well.

There was a point in my life where basically online interactions and phone calls/Skype chats were all I had for human interaction. Once they started to dry up for whatever reason, I grew more and more unstable. It sucked.

There came a point where I realized I had to get through it all.",Depressed
"I have not played Animal Crossing yet, and I am not sure if I would ever play it, but I can see how such purity and cuteness could make you realize how things are for you. But I do wish you the best and I want to let you know that you're not alone; though great distances separate us and so much lies beyond you and me, I am happy to know you play that game to calm yourself and to keep you at ease. 

Giving you my support here too! \^\_\^

I'm also going through my own troubles, and I've gotten myself my first session with a professional after I was informed that what I'm going through was a mix of depression and anxiety.",Depressed
"I feel you. I recently purchased a paddle-board in an attempt to get out of the apartment more, maybe meet people. It is great fun (I am currently sore as all get out and sunburnt to hell), but then I remembered I have an intense fear of being on the water in small craft haha.   


Anyhoo, I forget where I was going. I cry at the dumbest shit now. Like, I feel incompatible with the rest of the human race. So I go to work, and I go home.   


After I bought the board I was contemplating for hours paddling out with a heavy rock tied to my neck and just dropping into the depths.   


But the sun feels good when it shines, I hope you can find the sun to warm your heart and soul.  It is rough, and life is not a trifle. Pain is part of it unfortunately, I have yet to figure my pain out, but I truly wish the best for you. Remember, everyone is deserving of love, especially self love. I love you, and everyone reading this.   


It would be cliche and foolish to say we are all in this together.. because unfortunately we are not, BUT we can at least strive to be!   


Keep fighting the good fight!",Depressed
"My mom once put my cat/best friend down after she put him on medication because he wouldn't walk on her dirty and cold floors.  She said his liver was failing, but he was great, just messed up because of the antidepressants she put him on.  We would go for walks every day. I never got to say goodbye. He just wasn't there when I got home to take him for a walk. Every time I walked along our trails, I bawled.  Then I picked up World of Warcraft. A tiger and I fought and I couldn't put it on myself to kill it. I succumbed to it killing my mage and I wept because it looked so much like my cat. I imagined it was my friend coming back to play once more. Now, if I ever want to see my cat again, I can just go into that world and be with him once more.  

It's nice having surrogates for friends, especially in these tough times.  Video games are a perfectly healthy way to help ease our loneliness and depression. I hope you make lots of friends and get to show them around the little world that you create.  It's not sad or pathetic that you found something beautiful in this world and it happened to be digital.  Maybe one day you'll get to see someone singing on the waters edge in the outside world.  If you want to make a real friend, that plays Animal Crossing, and likes to sing, then I suggest looking up Ayytrae on Twitch. She'll make your day better.",Depressed
"This is such a pure, sweet moment. I’m glad you shared. This quarantine has been such an emotional rollercoaster. I got laid off, am in a foreign country far from home, and I’m watching my money slowly dwindle away. It’s really scary, but I find the small moments in my life right now really touch me. Things like remembering that I had this little book of connect the dot puzzles my sister had given me years ago, or a little cross stitched picture of Yoda with the quote “Do or do not, there is no try.” It’s honestly the little moments that touch me the most right now, and I find myself so overcome with emotions some days. 

Just a couple days ago I put on some music, and a song came on that I noticed was from 2000. It then made me feel so unbelievably old and nostalgic in a sad way. Realizing I couldn’t get that moment in life back, but it seemed so much better than the present. I felt the goosebumps come all down my body, and I started to tear up. It’s such a small thing, but it really affected me. 

Anyway, if ever I get a Switch, I’ll go visit your island and catch bugs with you. Keep your head up!",Depressed
At least you have a game like animal crossing that's calm and peaceful. I have games like hyrule warriors where I die every five seconds because the cpu won't listen to my commands and die.,Depressed
"This is painfully relatable, my gf left me at the start of this whole cronovirus pandemic, and a few weeks ago I went to therapy because I couldn't stand being alive and everything was overall a struggle. Found out I am depressed for a few years(I'm also an 18 year old and thought I was just sad sometimes which I thought is normal). I really hope you will get better and find something you can get passionate about to  ease the pain. Just try to stick to a schedule and to keep everything in control. Good luck to everyone struggling with depression and this whole virus!",Depressed
Nintendo switch users are soy filled cry babies,Depressed
Is it even possible to beat animal crossing?,Depressed
"I always take my meds, but the worse I get is not showering cuz it just takes so damn much energy. I can’t get anyone to understand that climbing over the tub to sit down on a shower chair is not laziness it takes way more energy than I have. Doc put me on vitamin D see if that helps. Here’s to day 1 of 100 (bottle) seeing how it does. 

Just remember you don’t take your meds you get worse that’s why we take them. I know same with shower lol. Good luck. You got this!",Depressed
"Yep. Same with showering and brushing my teeth. 

If the meds did anything noticeable for me I’d be more motivated to take them,  but no.",Depressed
"   
I'm so unmotivated that I can't even go to the psychologist",Depressed
"Yup. It's the ""I just can't"" mechanism, and it's very familiar to pretty much all the people I know with depression, including myself. 

This is normal. Not a good thing, mind you. But normal. My best solution has been to make sure that someone else brings me my meds and a glass of water morning and afternoon and watches me take them.",Depressed
"I hate taking my meds too, just the thought of opening the bottle and getting the pills takes a shitload of energy.",Depressed
"Not only do I go without taking my meds at times...I recently threw several months supply away. I'm so tired of being a walking pharmacy. I'm 35 not 90, but I take 4 rx's and 3 supplements plus an injection every 2 weeks...

10 pills every morning, should additionally take 1 in the afternoon but I usually forget that one anyway.  

And they are all things that will either get worse over time, or at best stay the same.",Depressed
Yes and not showering for many days.,Depressed
"I don’t really use meds, I tend to abuse them and rather stick to sports than chemical Pharma stuff",Depressed
Personally I’m Un-medicated but I get too depressed to shower all the time.,Depressed
"Yep, i sometimes forget for days.",Depressed
YESSSSSSS( and I know it makes it worse not being consistent w my meds) Also agreeing w/ Rubicon with showering taking energy I really feel that. I have almost little to no motivation for daily tasks and when trying to make a learn a new hobby or fix my schedule or even have a schedule it is extremely hard to follow. That might be from some of my laziness but I my Anxiety and Depression definitely contribute.,Depressed
"Yes and after 5 days my anxiety becomes the worst and can't do anything because of it
Same thing with brushing my teeth and changing clothes",Depressed
I wouldn't have a problem taking my meds if they actually did a damn thing,Depressed
All the freaking time! I’ve probably gone a month without taking my meds. What’s worse is that I’m diabetic (type 2) so most of my meds are for that.,Depressed
No,Depressed
I don’t even have meds because I feel like I’m not in depression I just think I’m normal😬on top of that when I do feel depressed I push it away and I just go on with my day. Not sure if I’m happy or depressed I’m just confused on how I feel,Depressed
Yes,Depressed
"Yes, it’s been more of a struggle for me lately.  I get nauseous when I look at them.",Depressed
I’m depressed that my parents even think I need meds along among other things.,Depressed
Yup! Sometimes it’s hard. Plan and simple.,Depressed
Yeah. Some days are so bad that you can't even sit up. Thankfully my family helps me during this time. Missing meds for more than two days only makes things worse.,Depressed
"BIG FACTS holy shit I was just thinking this. Thunk this is like the 6th day in a row? I just can’t go more than a couple of days taking pills before I lose the motivation to take em again. They work well and I really do need them but I dunno what it is about showering, teeth brushing, sleeping, eating and/or taking meds but I just don’t got the energy to do then anymore nowadays.",Depressed
"Yes, I've been there. Both with my thyroid med and my antidepressant. I've talked about this with therapists so often it's embarrassing. Even the little things that are supposed to help, like keeping a bottle of water and the meds right next to my bed, often don't work. I've gone weeks without my thyroid medication. Back when I took Prozac, I stopped taking it for so long I had the side effect of vivid nightmares when I took them again. 

It makes me feel like a total failure that I don't even manage to take a medication that substitutes/improves the work of an organ/gland that plays a role in so many important bodily processes. Like... which normal person looks at their thyroid pills and thinks ""Nah, these are optional""?",Depressed
no i dont take meds.,Depressed
"I don't take meds for depression, but for other reasons, and I usually need to be reminded to take them. I'm just so tired all the time and I'm can get myself stuck in my thoughts for hours.",Depressed
"Sadly yes, it's not a good habit at all though and there are repercussions",Depressed
I wish i had meds😢,Depressed
"i don’t take meds, but i can definitely relate to this in terms of taking a shower. i hate shower days. when i think about all the things i have to do to my hair after the shower (i have curly hair) it kills any motivation i had to get in. i absolutely hate having greasy hair and feeling dirty, but showering takes too much energy that i don’t have. thank god no one is seeing me these days.",Depressed
Yeah... Last January I was running out of antidepressants and didn't have any motivation to go to see my doctor just to get a prescription for more pills. I felt like they didn't help me one bit so i didn't bother.,Depressed
"If I were to stop taking my meds all of a sudden I’m fairly confident I’d kill myself. I rely on them heavily which I know isn’t good for me. But hey, at least I’m still here right?? Eh",Depressed
I’m so depressed I can’t even kill myself because I’m so unmotivated.... no will to live or whatsoever,Depressed
YESSS,Depressed
I hate taking medicine in general and just don’t have the energy to take antidepressants. Then I have this fear of getting the pill stuck in my throat.,Depressed
"Yeah, quarantine's been rough",Depressed
You should see my room.,Depressed
"When I forgot to take meds it gives me headache, headaches makes me angry ): plus I have problem swallowing pills... 

But I enjoy showering, that warm water is comfy",Depressed
Now imagine not even having them at home in the first place. I'd have to go to the pharmacy first lol,Depressed
"I haven't taken my meds in months now, I know I'm getting worse day by day, I don't get up, days go by and I can't get my self to get a shower my room is a mess, I cry all the time haven't talked to another soul in months, I know I need my meds but I can't do it... I can't even get motivated enough to do anything, everything is pointless",Depressed
I think you meant me for the past year and a half... sorry I’ll excuse myself.,Depressed
"It've come to the point where i can't be bothered to take a crap, shower or brush teeth. I'm pretty pathetic atm but yeah. Is what it is",Depressed
"Ironic, that’s what I’m doing right now. The meds aren’t cutting it so I don’t feel much different if I’m on them or not. The only thing my meds do is make me hungry, and right now I hate myself enough physically that I’d prefer not to eat, so I guess it’s a twisted kind of helpfulness.",Depressed
"been feeling the same way, all i wanna do is stay in my bed whole day doing nothing, and everything makes me anxious. hope you’re doing okay.",Depressed
Its 1pm and I can't bring myself to get out of bed,Depressed
"Yes, swallowing tablets physically hurts (medical reasons) and depression makes me go fuck.it and skip them.",Depressed
Me today and yesterday. It feels like the meds aren’t even helping anymore. Guess I’m just that stupid,Depressed
"Taking my meds is one of the few things I'm still just about motivated enough to do (most of the time). Brushing my teeth, showering and stuff like that is becoming harder and harder as the days go by.
Anyways just make sure you really do know that there's a bunch of people in this boat with you.",Depressed
"Yeah, I've been depressed since I was 8.  Just had the mother of my son leave me after ten years.  I've lost almost all my teeth since the whole relationship was a battleground, I never get to see my son, I walked out on my therapist the other day cause she slipped the door almost shut to talk to a coworker and I heard her say, I don't think I can help this kid.  I've stopped eating, showering, taking my meds, and leaving the house.  I get evicted in a few more weeks cause I'm laid off, and I don't have anything left to keep me going.",Depressed
Yes but if I dont take them I'm so depressed I'll die by my own hand.,Depressed
I hate having to take meds. It makes me feel like I can’t be normal unless I’m on some kind of drug. And even then I don’t feel normal,Depressed
don’t have to worry about that. my mom doesn’t want me on meds for a reason she has yet to explain.,Depressed
Meds ? What meds the ones thats called Anti Depressants or the meds like ACTUAL SUPPORTIVE FRIENDS who helps you through depression and actually calls you or messages you to hangout somewhere or actually play games together ?,Depressed
I'm so with you on this. Finally someone saying it other than reading up how people want their life back,Depressed
"I have to go back to work in a week and I'm dreading it. I've actually been near contentment in quarantine. I feel like alone in my home I can't just exist. I'm not forced to confront the fact that I don't know how to be a real person, and going back to faking it is going to be exhausting.",Depressed
Same thoughts. But my nightmare would come back soon 😭,Depressed
"Finally, someone understand what it feels like to be quarantined. As an introvert myself, I really enjoy investing myself, getting new hobbies and maybe I'll start my own music career. Don't understand why some people hate this lockdown. Anyway, this fun time will be over soon. I will miss that memories",Depressed
"Your feelings are valid, but have you tried to just completely delete all social media? I've heard some people have success in the regard you're referring to. Sorry to read that you're worried about this. Stay strong.",Depressed
"You don't know how much I'm worried that the lockdown's gonna end now. 

Im not a religious person but my parents are so they force me to go to church almost every single day. I don't want to be forced to be religious. I hate it",Depressed
"Yeah. I actually feel alive here and there, and it made me wanna fight for happiness. I used quarantine to make 3D models, excersise and walk the dog on the path behind our house, which is away from everyone.

I still am depressed, but I can breathe a little bit.",Depressed
"COVID gave me a place to cover up my depression. Before lockdown my motivation levels were in the toilet and my semester at uni was slipping away from me. I had an excuse to hide in my room all day, so no one noticed i didnt want to leave. 

Now that its easing, i was petrified about what kind of damage had been done by leaving my head in the sand. Luckily im feeling better now and so far everything seems to have worked out.",Depressed
"Man you said it! Most of the lockdown has been me doing college work, which was not fun at all! Now it’s been a week since I’ve finished up this semester and in the next few days the government will gradually be opening up the country again. It’s making me sad! I just want to rest!",Depressed
"I also really like this. I had trouble of looking for jobs for years before covid. Nothing ever hit. Even though my friends say I have a good resume, even though my parents have some connections, I can't land anything beyond 2 interviews over the last 2 years or so.

So with covid that pressure is off. I am lucky that since I live with my parents I have essentially no bills. The little work I do here and there helps me cover small things sometimes.

But for me this crisis state has just been true for a long time before covid hit. So I don't mind not having to solve it for a little bit.

It feels kinda nice to take the pressure out.",Depressed
"I feel the same way. And that scares me. I was finally making progress with my mental health for 6 months straight right before the lockdown began. Now I am back to square one. This place is comfortable and familiar.

But I don't want to live here forever.",Depressed
"Yes! I feel this. Quarantine has been a lovely honeymoon with myself. My mental health has never been better. I still have my issues, obviously, but they're so much more manageable with this lifestyle. I sleep from 9AM to 5PM, wake up fully rested, and I have relatively balanced mealtimes. This has been such a gift, and I'm savoring it.",Depressed
"I'm very optimistic in regards of how home office will be seen after this quarantine. I believe the business model will change a lot and introverts like us will be able to work at home, at least to some extent and, of course, depending on the job.
So hopes up, maybe the quarantine doesn't have to end and we will have more leeway about that.",Depressed
"i second you on this, i hate my area to bits and hate coming out because i feel so alienated and lost here and even though this lockdown has come with its hardships which outweigh the good, the one thing i can take from this is that i can stay home and not have to be outside constantly around people.",Depressed
"Lucky you.

My life never changed in the pandemic, in fact right before it started I had a shitty ""vacation"" which just ended up being a week of me playing therapist for another depressed person. There goes my one vacation.

I'm deteriorating.

I want to die so bad.",Depressed
"honestly i feel pretty different. like having to go out and do things was the daily push i needed to feel productive and good about myself. ever since lockdown i have lost all motivation and it’s almost like my depression is working in reverse. before, i would have places to be and things to do and that really helped keep my brain quiet. when i felt super depressed it would be because i didn’t *want* to do anything and nothing brought me joy. but now that i’m stuck at home, i still have things to do, but not being able to physically go to school is stopping me from getting even the minimal amount of work done. and it’s not that i don’t *want* to do things.. it’s like i need the routine to make it bearable. it’s not like before where i could just force myself to get out of bed and leave the house to go do whatever. now more than ever i feel like no matter what i do, i feel unmotivated, useless, and just terrible all around. a big part of it is a lack of social interaction. i feel like i dont have any friends. anyone else feeling this way? :/",Depressed
"Yeah, I can't fathom people wanting to go back to ""normal"" because ""normal"" was horrible for me.. for someone who is ""abnormal"", I guess.",Depressed
"You’ve put this into words perfectly! I have been struggling trying to find where I “fit in” at in life. I graduated college 3 years ago, dropped out of law school 2 years ago, and quit a dead end job a year ago. After looking for work and finally finding a decent paying job (though not a great work environment), I finally felt better. Like I was living my life as an average citizen. I lost that job due to Covid. I’ve been home and have embraced the slow paced life. I have enjoyed not seeing people on vacation, or bragging about work advancements, especially after feeling like a failure for so long. I am 25 (yes I know it’s young), but I have no idea where I want my life to go. No career idea, no career goals, no ‘5 year plan’. The thought is mentally/emotionally overwhelming. During this time, I have enjoyed my company, and my family’s company. All of the outside pressure has subsided. I can truly live in the moment and not the stressful state of mind that I have been in for years. I’m not sure what the future holds, but I can honestly say I’m not ready for it 😢",Depressed
"Can I ask why you are certain a fulfilling life is completely unattainable for you? 


I dropped the ""happy"" because that's a whole other philisophical rabbit hole.",Depressed
"Honestly, it's way too fucking soon.",Depressed
"I feel ya!! For me Zoom classes have been the best. Just wake up 5 mins prior, keep the microphone/camera off, just chill in bed half asleep taking notes when necessary, and leaving whenever you feel. No travelling, no traffic, no fuel usage, no rushing, no getting ready, no makeup/hair/clothes, no social anxiety, no interactions, no forced conversations, no time wasting.... just you and your mood fully embraced for what it is.",Depressed
"I've been unfortunate to have a chance to isolate myself for half a year before the quarantine in my home.

Trust me when I say that after some time it becomes the torture beyond your imagination. All of the things that you've been running from will eventually find you. Only this time you'll have nowhere to run.",Depressed
"Fuck I'm envious, I've had to work this whole time, except I had to flip my entire sleep schedule and there's way less to do. Also everyone is pissed that we're making way less than people on unemployment (I'm not.) I would fuckin love to get furloughed",Depressed
"Same. I've been able to start a regular meditation practice, lower my Zoloft dosage (hoping to continue to wean off completely), go for a run every day, transform my yard with new gardens, and spend time with my family. My husband and I thankfully are able to work full-time from home. My mental health has never been better, now that I have the time and space to focus on healing.",Depressed
Same and I'm practically agoraphobic now to boot. Dunno if I'm actually going to be able to go back to an office. I have panic attacks now even going to shop. Let alone sitting in a busy office for 8 hours a day,Depressed
"for me, I don't want it to end because that means I have to face reality. I have to find a job, I have to go on with school, I have to figure out my life, I have to move on and figure things out. I don't want to figure things out because I'm clueless.

I can go out to parks and public places that there are normally people in. It's so nice to get out and not have to see people and just enjoy time alone. I can play video games all I want.  

I just kinda want life to be on pause like this forever.",Depressed
"Why the literal fuck do you have to change any of this when the quarantine is over?

I for one, am changing back literally none of the lifestyle adjustments the quarantine required.

I've learned a lot about myself.  And that a lot of things that people think are wrong about me, or that I think are wrong about me... aren't. 

Maybe the only good thing about your experience with this crisis will be having your personal existence validated.

Ask yourself how much of your pre-quarantine life you, \*you\* feel you HAVE to go back to.  

And only go back to what you feel is absolutely necessary. 

You can wish it to end as mandatory for everyone, wish for the deaths to stop, and still be determined to keep these lifestyle changes where they benefit you.  That's actually completely legal.  

You aren't hurting anybody by doing that.",Depressed
"I think that's the point of all this. Drag it out long enough to the point where people are so comfortable and complacent they won't want to return to normalcy. Can you blame them? Who really wants to return to full time slave?

I too find solace in this mandatory solitude. No more feeling guilty for not being like everyone else; now you all have to adapt to MY lifestyle. I honestly haven't noticed much of a change other than longer lineups at the liquor store. In fact my life has honestly improved. I'm a delivery driver similar to uber eats except without the middle man. Only work part time yet make about as much as I would working a regular full time job. Was almost ready to call it quits due to orders being so low for a couple months. Though since the lockdown started business has been booming. On top of that all the things I've been warning about are all coming to light for everyone to see. People are waking up to the corruption and lies being perpetrated by the elite. No one with half a brain cell is buying this plandemic and these demonic neophytes are quickly realizing their agenda is falling apart at the seams. 

Though for me it doesn't matter what happens. I'm ready for whatever is coming.",Depressed
"Second this so hard, iso had let me not compare my social life to others and alleviates constant FOMO. It makes me feel like my lifestyle choices are normal and that self-care time is justified. Things that I usually don't have the mental capacity to engage with (e.g. small talk at work, hearing about people's travel plans, expectation to look presentable in public all the time, be interesting, etc.) have decreased, and I've been feeling so much better until now. I mean I'm glad the pandemic will be over, but selfishly I also wished it'd stay like this at least til the end of the year.",Depressed
"Same here, but my job said we may not go back to “normal” operations for a long time and will have many of us still work from home if possible. So that gives me some relief. For once the rest of the world is adjusting to the normal that we prefer.",Depressed
"me neither, also cause not much changed in my life

I feel bad for all the already struggling people who lost their job and stability, the few stability they had

This world is builded so it cannot stop ... it's really telling",Depressed
"Nope nope nope. All of my coping mechanisms had been based around distracting myself with schoolwork, hanging out with people, with the routine of life at college. 

Having to go home and do online classes has just left me alone with my own thoughts and made my mental health way worse. 

Maybe I’m in the minority here but I really don’t want society to shift towards us being more distant and isolated, isolation is what made me feel depressed in the first place.",Depressed
I also want the lockdown to stay,Depressed
"That's a well written expression of how a lot of people feel, I think. There's a lot of pressure to appear happy in America, even if it means faking it. People get so uncomfortable acknowledging this idea that things maybe aren't as great as we're all supposed to pretend they are.  When you can confront and embrace that, you can move to the next level.",Depressed
"I'm the same. The worst will be the thought of how much fun others are going to have once the lockdown is finished while I'll be back at being the ""loser"" who stay at home every evenings. I was secretly content that others were forced to spend the time as me for once.",Depressed
"I've been away from work for a month and it was a nice change of pace. 

Don't worry though. We're screwed until their is a vaccine.",Depressed
"I’ve lost all motivation, I don’t know how I will manage to cope when this lockdown is lifted.",Depressed
i wish i could do nothing without feeling guilty about it. if i stay home and do nothing my family would get mad at me and say i'm lazy,Depressed
"im my case, not for me. this isolation is making me insane since i have no distractions. my thoughts are killing me with overthinking, anxiety, and sadness",Depressed
"2020 is actually the best year of my life so far. I'm one of those types that can delve deep into hobbies and specific interests for years, so home life actually makes me much happier and calmer",Depressed
I completely feel the same way. I hope it stays,Depressed
"OMG! I'm not alone! I just ""smile"" when people write me ""I cant wait for the lockdown to finish to return to normality""",Depressed
I completely agree with you,Depressed
I feel the same way!! It’s like I don’t feel this pressure of having to go outside and be productive all day. I don’t have this pressure that I’m suppose to have a career (I’m graduating college in a month) I constantly feel like a failure because I compare myself to everyone and it feels so nice that everyone is in the same position and just stuck,Depressed
"Then don’t let it. You can still stay in your house, you have a perfectly good reason to. The virus isn’t over, people are still getting infected like crazy.",Depressed
"Yes I hate to be selfish and inconsiderate of the people who have died, are or were sick, struggling because of no money/ job but these last two months have been awesome for me.

Over the last four years since graduating college, I have worked jobs I hate and been miserable always looking for a new one. I chose the wrong job field and I don’t have the money to get a second education. I’ve been super depressed, felt trapped by my own choices and suicidal at some points. 
Over the last two months, I’ve been able to stay home, relax, get outside spend time with my dog who otherwise sits at home all day, read, write, and think about what I want to actually do with the rest of my life. I also will get the chance to really search for a job instead of taking one because I need the money. 

I don’t want the lock down over either, but not at the expense of other people’s lives. So I guess I’ll be grateful for the time I’ve had.",Depressed
I feel like less of a failure with this lockdown.,Depressed
I'm actually happy for the first time in years. My depression is rooted in financial insecurity and the stress of spending all my time at work only to still not make enough to survive. Right now I'm pursuing my dream career of music full time and making more money on unemployment to fund it than I've ever made at a job.,Depressed
"I just want to stay home forever. I hate going out, interacting with strangers, going to work, all that shit. I don't want to go back to normal. Just let me stay home...",Depressed
"I’ve been depressed for years and even I know this lockdown is not good for people, you need to get outside be productive and work. This mentality is destroying the economy and it’s a cancer in America’s society today",Depressed
Quarantine is the best thing to ever happen to me.,Depressed
Won't end until a vaccine. May stay up to 2 years,Depressed
Yeah honestly it's been a blessing..a two month long vacation..and counting,Depressed
I want it to get worse.,Depressed
"Agreed. 

As someone with the social anxiety, I’m living the dream. 

But yes, my heart is also with those who passed away from this nasty virus.",Depressed
"I understand completely. It’s been great being able to avoid the triggers for my anxiety. But I hope you take the time to cultivate the inner strength you need, so that when the lockdown ends you’ll be better equipped to deal with life as it comes.",Depressed
Yeah tell that to the people who have abusive/toxic parents and partners at home who they have yet to fully escape from. You're just being selfish by saying that. Some people were ready to have 2020 be their year and now that isn't looking so grand. You're lucky to still have your job while others struggle to even make ends meet therefore worsening their depression.,Depressed
Apparently I'm not the only one.,Depressed
No one does bro.,Depressed
I feel that,Depressed
I am with you in that,Depressed
S A M E 🥺,Depressed
I was scared when lockdown first started but I’ve adapted to the situation better than I imagined. I don’t want it to end suddenly now I’m used to it.,Depressed
"Me too.
The only issue I have is that many e-commerce companies are delivering essential items only.",Depressed
I can relate to this so much...,Depressed
"Same. working from home has been pretty great, I can be just as productive but not feel exhausted by mandatory hours on my less busy days. I also have managed to pick up not one but two new hobbies while having extra time at home and I am super sad that we're returning to a half normal work schedule.   


The only good thing about things starting to reopen is that I can go back to my new therapist. video calls with people I don't really know give me some mad anxiety so I haven't been able to 'go'. I'd only seen her once before the whole thing hit and made a single attempt at a video call that I promtly hung up on after 3-4 minutes of extremely uncomfortable smalltalk and silence.",Depressed
"I’ve been lucky to be able to work from home since March 15th, and will probably be allowed to through the month of June or longer due to having health problems. I’ve enjoyed every minute of it.  I don’t like that people are getting sick, but I love not having to deal with people face to face and all the negativity that comes from that. Wish I could work from home forever.",Depressed
Yep now I have an excuse to be a piece of shit,Depressed
It is a good time for you to think of a career that would be more fulfilling. You have this time to help yourself. Get yourself a therapist they are online or find a peer group that can help with your feelings and mindset. Who know you may have new chapter in your life. Just try the possibility is there. Best of luck to you. Just take the first step,Depressed
I’m the exact same. Everyone thinks I’m mad for enjoying this,Depressed
I'm with you. I also don't want the lockdown to end,Depressed
"Granted. No, I mean for real we will stay like this maybe for the rest of our lifes. And I love it. 

I'm with you, before the lockdown started I was practically living on social isolation, probably a lot of you had been doing it as well. However, there's people who just cannot deal with this so they will pushing to lift up lockdown.

I don't care what they do, I will isolate myself for my own mental healt. Anyways as I told you, we never come back to *""normality""* after this and I'm so glad fo that.",Depressed
Thank you thank you thank you for saying this out loud!! 😭 I feel this. I feel bad for thinking this way but also a bit like “finally it’s not just me who get to experience something that’s not that funny and mess up your plans living in a constant fog of not knowing how long this will continue” kinda thoughts just give me comfort that I’m not miserable alone,Depressed
"Me too 74, me too. Perhaps this is the only time I've felt so normal with all the lifestyle I have.",Depressed
I've been more productive during lockdown than before. I started two part time jobs right before the lockdown and they're both considered essential and before I started working I was just sitting at home all day playing video games. I do that still but at least I get a paycheck,Depressed
Going back to work in a couple of days and I am not ready.,Depressed
"i was only waiting for an occasion like this, being able to do nothing and nobody can tell you anything",Depressed
"Honestly the thing I've been most scared about is that after all this, I won't have a reason for my depression anymore. Everyone I've tried to speak to, for the most part, has been more forgiving/ understanding than ever because 'everyone's going through the same thing'. What happens when this is over and I'm still feeling the same?",Depressed
yes I can’t relate to people saying they miss their life before the quarantine (going out and doing things and hanging out with friends and going to work) because I did none of those things before! I am a bit upset because some of my plans have been postponed.. but tbh I’m thankful that the quarantine has given me an excuse to do what I normally do which is basically nothing :( lol,Depressed
The only downside to all this is that I can't go to restaurants for a while.,Depressed
I know right? Hopefully thousands of people keep dying every day so we can benefit by staying home.,Depressed
"Well for some people best times of their life, for others with mentally exhausting family (in many ways) as well as lack of communication, this lockdown is suffocating",Depressed
"agreed, I really like not having social obligations. I also loved working from home, but  in my state we were allowed to go back to work in our office last week. so I'm back in the office and I hate it! ugh, my co workers are so annoying and its so pointless, like why should I drive to the office to sit at the computer all day when I could do the same exact thing at home? 

I've also lost weight because I can keep track of what I'm eating so much better when I'm not at a restaurant or bar. I might just become a hermit permanently lol.

but I also realize I am extremely lucky that I have a full time job that doesn't involve dealing with the public, I have a great partner who I live with and get to be with every day, my financial situation was very good before this pandemic, and I am an introvert so I actually like not interacting with people. so a lot of it does have to do with circumstance and personality...",Depressed
"you guys say this because you're full grown adults, as a teen that has no choice or say in what your parents do, theres literally nothing you can do but sit your ass and complete about 3 tests a week and then sleep wake up get online do the same thing the next day",Depressed
The last time I went out the mall was seemingly abandoned (it was renovating too) felt like a wonderland to me. (Was buying funds for my steam wallet at the time),Depressed
"I’m not depressed at all and haven’t been for years but I’m loving quarantine. Loving reading, home projects, pondering life. Realized how annoying my ex gf was and got out of that. I’m free to explore most of my hobbies/interests with no time restrictions",Depressed
"Got called back into work last week (UK) and can confirm, living in hell.",Depressed
"I totally feel you. At first, I hated how unproductive I felt, but now I’m in this bubble of just relaxation and I don’t want to leave it. I know I’m unhappy though, it’s the familiarity that is so comforting to me. There’s a nagging thought in the back of my head reminding me that this is unsustainable and I’m running out of money.",Depressed
" I agree, my mom said to me earlier this week that I need to get out sometime and I awkwardly laughed but honestly I’m staying in for as long as I can",Depressed
So true. I feel the same.,Depressed
Nice that most people got a vacation when essential workers are working themselves to death. Shit like that makes me want to end it.,Depressed
I still get stressed everyday because of my fucking online school overworking all of us and my parents concerned with me getting my assignments turned in. My cousin who has something wrong with her likes to be super annoying won't stop bothering me bc she just moved into my neighborhood. I am just so fucking done with life. I can't stop hanging out with her because my parents keep making me hang out with her. SELF CARE IS FUCKING REAL AND NO ONE IN MY FUCKING LIFE CAN FUCKING RESPECT THAT. I need some pills.,Depressed
"   
I love the lockdown, I wanted it to last forever. It's been a paradise for me. If I lived alone it would be even better",Depressed
Yes glad that show off in Instagram are finally gone🤷.,Depressed
Honestly either way I would be depressed as fuck so it don’t matter to me at this point,Depressed
"There is so much sympathy going around for single people who are isolating alone and the toll that must take. It weird to see the entire while acknowledging that because I’ve had deep depressive episodes. There was a time in my life where I spent a year in a god awful apartment with putrid brown carpeting.  I had recently moved from out fo state, I didn’t drive and public transportation was awful. It was a bleak terrible time on my life. If anyone has read the yellow wallpapers I related to that a lot. 

Thankfully I’m in a much healthier place now. I drive. I love my apartment. I live on a lake. I’m an introvert that enjoys spending time with my animals and doing crafts and home projects. For me it’s been great. Like this is nothing compared to my past. 

Alas I start a new job Monday. Which really is great. But I’m going to miss this.",Depressed
"I think it's a double-edged sword. I was recently laid off in California, and obviously stuck at home. I've dealt with a couple bad episodes in the last month but I feel like it would have been worse without the lockdown. The fact that my isolation right now is justified, can't hang out with friends or really go out, makes it so I'm not criticizing myself for that.

On the other hand, I wish I could see some of my friends or even go to a movie by myself. It would help me feel better about myself.",Depressed
"This. I finally feel like I belong again, which I haven’t felt since high school. Since I don’t have a car, I already get my haircuts at home. I already get food delivered to me. I already take online classes. I already look for online jobs. In this horrible pandemic, there is one silver lining and that is the fact that my life is normalized. I know eventually that barbershops will be reopened and so will restaurants and schools, so my life will no longer be considered normal. But I’m living in the moment and I’m at least glad that it is for now.",Depressed
"i dont know, like my other half contacted my parents today , for some sort of intervention , god knows . they just dont get it at all",Depressed
Me neither,Depressed
"I’m especially happy about some of the positive effects it’s having on air quality, water, and general pollution. Many animal species are able to come out of hiding. However, one negative effect I’ve noticed in my community is the abundance of discarded masks and gloves littering the ground. I mean..... do people just remove them and throw them to the wind???


People are at home with their families, spending time with their families. I see so many people gardening and actually cleaning up their homes. Kids are outside playing; some kids are inside helping cook. 


The materialistic market-obsessed economy is on pause, more or less. 


I am speaking of the observable ideals; I am in no way denying any other effects from the lockdown and not denying that each person has their own reality. But, it is actually somewhat peaceful at times if you can step outside yourself and see the positive impacts on the world around you.",Depressed
"Dude, same. This year’s school stressed me so badly (sleeping and eating little, panicking here and there, feeling awful about my existence with every test the school throws at me) that I’m really glad to be home. It’s where I can just rest and focus on getting better.",Depressed
"There is only one person I would really need, who has chosen not to talk to me anymore a long time ago. That will always hurt.
Living was tiresome before the pandemic, now it is a bit more hectic (personal projects, much more reading) yet less tiresome.",Depressed
"I feel this too. I'm making more on unemployment than I made working almost full time at my job and I'm able to focus on my school work (which has all been moved online,) which has helped my grades improve tremendously. On top of anxiety over people going out too soon/without protection, my depression has been more mellow lately because I haven't been forced to go out and interact with others every day.",Depressed
"Oh man, I am exactly the opposite. I’ve barely left my bed since lock down began 2 months ago. My favorite activity is staring at the wall for hours.",Depressed
If I go back to work part time can I still get the 600 a week?,Depressed
Right.I hear you on this one.,Depressed
"Totally understandable. Being at home and doing wfh with reduced hours has helped me realize just how toxic of a situation I was putting myself in on a daily basis. I don't want to go back to that, and given the state of jobs and the economy, idk what would happen if I were to quit. It isn't really like there's tons of job opportunities opening up.

I've had time to catch up on projects that I've never felt I had the time to do and time to sit with myself and actually sort out what kind of goals I want to set in life. 

I miss being able to see my family in person but again, I never had enough time to do that before covid.",Depressed
So happy I don't have social aside from Reddit...,Depressed
i know exactly what you mean. i really am hoping i can get on unemployment and just enjoy existing in peace for a while. i dread the day life goes back to normal,Depressed
"I often feel the same, but feel bad because of why it exists",Depressed
"I feel that. I’ve been loving teleworking and from home instead of commuting into the city and sitting in a cubicle all day. But right before the pandemic, I was actually at a really good place and had pulled myself out of the hole of misery that I was in pretty much all last year. I met someone awesome and am in a relationship now, which has helped a lot. But now that it’s hard to see each other, and he’s about to go away to a training school for the army, and I have little else to distract me, I family and friends aren’t comfortable with me coming over bc I live in the city.... so I’m afraid that I’m going to regress right back into the hole if things don’t get better soon...",Depressed
I work at a theme park and I'm dreading having to go back to work since it's near impossible to do social distancing,Depressed
"I was so happy, being creative and making plans for my business etc. I made a fucking AUTUMN LEAF CROWN for a zoom party. As soon as we hit level 2 again, my anxiety and depression is back and my motivation is gone. fff",Depressed
You know I've been thinking the exact same thing... I just didn't know how to put it into words. But you pretty much nailed it. I'm going to miss my bed. I have slept so much.,Depressed
"Since the lock down started, I haven't felt so bad about having no social life. I can stay home on weekends without people feeling sorry for me. It feels like a breath of fresh air.",Depressed
"i complete understand, same thing here..",Depressed
"I couldn’t agree more. It kind of plateaus most people on what they’re able to do at the time, just stay home and not really do anything. Obviously it sucks, but I don’t have to compare myself, or feel guilty about doing nothing, or leading a life to absolutely nowhere. It was all really blissful at the time.",Depressed
why do you feel like a happy and fulfilling life is unattainable for you? I'm dreading going back to social life and realizing that i don't really have much friends.,Depressed
"Honestly yeah. It is a little comforting knowing that my friends also had to take a break from life due to all this, so as to not remind myself how horribly I've fallen behind. I know it isn't a race, but its difficult to not compare.",Depressed
"i feel you. my life isn't that tough since I'm just in college, but just before all this went down i was having a really tough time coping with everything. am currently in my 2nd year if engineering and was preparing for internship interviews, along with working for the tech fest and also balancing course work. it gets hellish and my sleep cycle, eating habits were fucked. I'm not proud to say this but I'm so happy with how unproductive i can be now. i know i should utilize this time to grow myself but it feels so relaxing to not have deadlines pressing down on you from all sides.",Depressed
At some point i'm sure my employer is gonna force me back i'm sure.,Depressed
Agreed!,Depressed
"This is a mood. I had to start back to work yesterday and it is so mentally and physically draining. I basically didn't talk to anyone for the majority of my shift yesterday. Just being out of the house somewhere I can't escape from took so much energy out of me. I thought back to my days of working 12-hour shifts at my last job and I don't know how I managed it without killing anyone (even though I will admit that I thought about it).

&#x200B;

I'd love to be able to just stay home with my cat and my fiancee and not have to worry about going places where I am expected to be a functioning human being and socialize with people I don't even know, or even care to socialize with. I've been trying to find a work at home job so I can make this dream a reality.",Depressed
"I get where you're coming from.

Skies are finally clear. Safe for those annoying bikers, noise from traffic has decreased significantly, it feels a little more peaceful.",Depressed
"Thank you so much for sharing this, thought I was alone tbh. Been feeling kinda crazy for feeling this way but I think it might be more common than I originally thought",Depressed
"I feel so conflicted on this. I like my retail job a lot, I like the location and the people I work with. My salary is a pittance and I barely, b a r e l y scrape a living, but I like my job.

But when my boss told me I can return next week, I almost had a panic attack.

I feel disgustingly anxious, unhappy, and depressed. It felt nice to hide away from the world, and let any semblance of a schedule and normality slip through my life like sand. And now that structure, or a little of it is back...eh.

I am so grateful to still have a job, and yet I don't want to go back. I hate myself for feeling like this.",Depressed
"Same. I have a legitimate excuse to not be working and to not be doing much. Also, I hate the aspect of going back to normal life.",Depressed
"I honestly can’t agree with this enough other than my grandpa going from showing signs of cancer to being now in hospice all during the outbreak (in the span of 3 weeks) has not made this fun, we have finally been allowed to see him since but it’s too late, now he’s unresponsive, he’s on so many meds that the most he can do is nod his head or shrug but those are very rare and have only happened when asked if he’s ok, we don’t even know if he can hear or understand us as we say our goodbyes to him. However this is better then finding out your grandma suddenly died while your in a mental facility after being moved there from jail for getting high at school to deal with thoughts of self harm just to end up snapping and using your knife on a kid that’s been picking on you the past few months. Yeah that was my lowest and even tho it was in 2017 it feels like last week, sorry I went way off track, but my point is the best we can do now is try and find the best of our situation, try and make something positive out of it, example if you were laid off think of this as a time to maybe look for a job you might enjoy more or if you love your job learn more about it, I’m glad you found your positive op",Depressed
Agreed.,Depressed
Well for me it's not good to be home alot each to their own,Depressed
"I was like, quarentine isn't that much different than my normal life. My insomnia is worse, but at least I don't want to die when I'm inside my house and not thinking about how bad I suck in every single way shape and form.",Depressed
"Omg I thought I was alone. It feels sick to think this way, humans are interesting creatures.",Depressed
"Haha,  I'm with you on this one! Working from home is actually kind of nice. I struggle with socialization and not having to deal with people is helping me. It's kind of paradoxical because I'm feeling very isolated, but that type of socialization I prefer is not one that is not driven by work. I like it when it's more genuine. 

Social media - I don't use it, but I imagine people aren't saying ""This person is my world"" because they are trapped at home with them all day without anything to do. 

The only things I miss are being able to go to the gym...and being able to get a haircut.

I also can never have a happy and fulfilling life due to my mental problems. So, the fact that everyone is struggling now is kind of nice because I don't feel like the only one.",Depressed
I feel the same except it’s hard not being able to go to the doctor because of the risk of getting corona. I’m worried about my health not related to corona,Depressed
"I’ve made lots of progress on being social, which had really had a good impact on my wellbeing (well besides a few issues with a particular person) and this quarantine has really regressed a lot of the progress I’ve made so personally it’s been really bad and I’ve not felt closer to suicide in years :(

Also routine plays a big factor on my life and without a schedule for the day or a task I fail to give myself anything to do and do nothing. 

Luckily I’m back at work on Monday which will be good for me I think.",Depressed

I can sort of agree with that. But there seems to be too many things to talk about, and it's all so many meaningless things anyway, no one will understand, and I don't think anyone will want to listen.

I have a feeling after lockdown, the groupchats im in, and other ways of me communicating with friends will be dead. They will all meet up without me. I know I have been negative, and it seems like this lockdown will be a perfect opportunity for them to distance themselves from me. Interestingly i'm not mad, I don't want myself dragging them down.

"My mother explicitly decided that her kids wouldn't be brought up in the church because of some bad experiences she had. As an adult I can understand and appreciate her decision, but looking back I can see how it impacted us three kids. We didn't have anything to anchor our beliefs to; we didn't have any explanation for what life is and why we're here. We have been more or less materially successful, but when you don't even have answers to the most basic questions of life, you will eventually have to confront that.

I started to confront it shortly after high school. I took some time off, experimented with drugs, and started asking questions. And then realized I had no clue why I was here or what I was supposed to do. That question ""what is life"" rocked my world, I dropped out of everything, sold all my stuff, and started traveling the world trying to find the answer. Although I was hostile to organized religion, like you, I realized the purpose it played in someone's life.

Just think about it. The first question is: what is life? Once you have an answer, you can then start forming some beliefs. Then you can start identifying the important beliefs among those - your values. Once those are in place, a purpose will form. And with a purpose, aligned with your values, beliefs, and idea of what life is, you can form goals and take actions to live your purpose. So deprived of any sort of foundation, what are you building your life on?

I realized a bit later in life that my values, purpose, and beliefs were there, but they all stemmed from the old American adage, ""you can be anyone and do anything"". And that is actually a terrible belief system because it tells you that ""being someone"" and ""doing something"" is the purpose. In other words, doing things that other people think are important is the purpose. AKA, being successful and recognised. And none of those people I knew who had some set of religious convictions from an early age swallowed that message as deeply as I did. They had their own issues of course, but they sidestepped some of the major challenges faced by someone who has no real spiritual foundation.

Now I spend my time trying to unravel this manufactured belief system and I've made progress. Anyway, I really understand your post. Thanks for sharing.",Depressed

"Religion can often be a source and gateway for abuse, bigotry, corruptness, hate, thought control and so on.

I could not imagine being religious ever again after the pain, mental conditioning and restraints I've been given. Be proud you're immune to the trap religious leaders have devised for you.

It sounds like you've tried a lot of different things. Far more than me. 30 was a tough time for me too, but since then things have both gotten worse and better.

I don't think it ends, frankly. I think we just get better at managing it. Or we don't. I believe that we have to make that decision ourselves - are we going to make this easier on ourselves, or harder? 

There is one thing that I can offer that worked for me and I'm confident will work for pretty much everyone else: take a break. Take 6 months off and go to a different country. A few thousand dollars and you can spend 6 months in Asia, Central or South America. Getting away is really therapeutic, especially when you're alone.

"It is often hard to describe the feeling to others. Years ago I was listening to an episode of Sincerely X by TED. In this episode, the anonymous speaker describes two analogies for her depression that have stuck with me, and I think about very often. 

First, she describes her feeling of depression as though she has been a dog that was hit by a car on a very busy freeway. The dog got thrown to the side, and there are all kinds of cars driving by, but they can't stop for fear of getting in an accident themselves. They feel pity. As they are going by their heads kind of turn to look at this creature that can't get better and nobody can help. 

Further, she likens her experience of depression to being an animal at the zoo, in a cage. Her family comes to visit and looks at her - she sees that they have so much love in their faces, and she knows they want her to do well. They put their arms through the cage (she won't bite them), and they soothe her the best way they can. But the bell rings or the horn blows and the zoo closes, and they go. And she is left in her cage.

as a young kid, i always wondered why some people were always sad like why can't they just flick the switch? i always thought mental health was a complete joke. it still amazes me each day what depression does to the human brain.

i never imagined my life being this shit at age 19, that's for sure. i look in the mirror everyday and i don't recognise myself, because i should've never ended up like this and i refuse to accept that i was born just to end up a miserable piece of shit at such a young age when i should have everything going for me atm.

Here are some thoughts 



If you’re a man: men have a tendency to question authority more than women. So like if the system is telling you “work hard, get a nice job and have kids, it’s the way just keep at it” women are more likely to go with that and that’s enough for them. Second, masculinity is totally at odds with modernity and is in perpetual crisis. It weakened (and, in the West, we became affluent) enough for women to reinvent femininity into something strong and proud. Not so with men. We are left with nothing, no purpose, and additionally lots of toxic shit that prevents us from escaping that



My best friend argues that we are hardwired to solve problems. But there are no more good problems—certainly nothing we as individuals can change. So we try to solve ourselves. But that’s doomed. No one can solve themself... except people on the screen. And guess what we have more of today than ever before? Media.


There’s no solution. None of what I’ve said is helpful. But yeah. It hurts. 



My ex told me recently that the light had gone out of my eyes. That I wasn’t the person she’d known. I agreed with her. I can’t even process that interaction because it would never stop and I would destroy anything that’s left of myself",Depressed
"Yeah, depression and anxiety is really hard to live with. I have that. It’s hard to have motivation to do anything, and then when you do, it’s sad not to feel any enjoyment. It feels empty. I ask the obvious but here it goes anyway. Any help from psychiatrist and therapy? Sometimes, it doesn’t pan out. 

Sorry you feel like an outsider even when meeting people. I think that loneliness is due a lot to depression and definitely anxiety. Maybe also to growing up with no friends and no one to talk to about it. 

If you feel lazy, you can feel judged by society. You try, so how can you be lazy if your body and mind prevent you. But a lot of society doesn’t understand depression and how it turns your brain off, prevents motivation and focus. Everything can feel hopeless. And any pressure using your mind to make money or do something can feel impossible.

Did you ever feel like you had hope that things would get better? 

There was a good question yesterday in this post. https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gj29ml/how_do_you_keep_eating_to_live_if_you_have_no/

It made me really think. I don’t know the answer really. But I could really relate. I wrote too much in the comment but it felt good to write my thoughts out. 

I have depression with some anxiety but not social anxiety so I can only imagine how much fear people bring up for you. And how uncomfortable that must feel.  Have you thought about trying a meetup.com online meeting? You can join one in a different city or country. It could be interesting to see if it lowers social anxiety since you may never see these people again so who cares if you feel judged.

But in reality, it was all bullshit because I was, and am, completely lost.

Saying that out loud - ""I'm lost"" - was actually the most important thing I ever did. It meant I could stop pretending I knew what I was doing, and start actually living with some purpose. And what I realized was pretty clear: when you're lost, you only want one thing. To get home. Getting home is the only purpose for those of us who are tired of life. Not taking pills, getting treatment, and pretending that life is something it isn't.

Getting home gave me purpose. Where is home? That's up to you to decide, but to me, home is not life. Life is endless, cyclical pain and suffering. I accept that. But I also know that I won't get there by sitting down and wishing I wasn't here. Forgive me, but I see you as one of the lost, who is awake enough to know you're lost, but who has stopped along the trail home somewhere to lament your fate.

We need to trek through this barren wasteland called life until we find home. All the shiny bullshit and distractions that titillate all the other lost people who have no clue they are lost, don't pull us in because we know that it's all bullshit. Because our mission is singular: get home. Don't stop on the trail and despair. Wake up, get back on your feet, and keep moving. We know things that the others don't.",Depressed

"yeah. I mean,  I've gotten pretty used to it as it's been 2 years of it and two hospital stays. I believe that I will have the guts to do it at some point. I started also collecting items that I want to display at my funeral. I don't think anyone would care either way if I was thinking of offing myself. I don't really have close friends, and I've been single a long time.",Depressed
"It does go away atleast it did for me three times 😂. I've had three episodes of depression with suicidal thoughts/wants only went through with it once  lasted for over a year each time I think.

"I chew my lips til they bleed and a big help is to log it for a month. Carry a little book around and write the date & time everytime you go to do it. By noting it down, your mind starts to recognise the habbit. Hope this helps.",Depressed
Have you tried putting a rubber band around your wrist and snapping it instead or getting some sort of fidget toy.,Depressed
"I used to scratch my legs whenever I got anxious. I didn't realize what I was doing until I started bleeding due to scratching one day. You can find a workaround that will stop you from scratching or hitting yourself, but anxiety will come out in some other way. Treat the root cause, not the symptom.  


Quick solutions - 

1. Deep breathing
2. Open windows, and let fresh air and light come in
3. Resist craving and divert your mind
4. Do opposite action, rather than scratching start putting moisturizer on it every time it itches
5. Listen to this every time you get panicky.  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmRi0Z7tdTY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmRi0Z7tdTY)

Longer term solutions to treat the root cause - 

1. Meditate - 10 minutes a day can really help wonder. Anxiety is a problem of mind, you need to treat the mind and meditation does that. I also never thought it would be this powerful, but my itching which was there for 5 months now, is gone completely.
2. Workout - While meditation attacks the mind, workout provides body with essential hormones to change thinking. If meditation is 'push', workout is 'pull'. Not only it will improve your health, but psychological well being as well. It makes mind strong.
3. Take cold showers!",Depressed

The only thing I found that helped me personally was to root out the sources of the pain and take direct aim at them through direct action and babystepping.

"Improvement isn’t instant and small highs and lows look like mountains and valleys close up. 

Things will probably get better and things will probably get worse. Many of these things you can’t change, or can’t immediately, but you can focus on improving how you react to these hardship and focus on solving the issues that cause them. 

That’s how “it gets better”. It may not seem like life is getting “better” at first but when it does it will be because of the effort you put in to it. 

At least that’s how I see it. 

Will “better” come quickly? 
Perhaps, but not likely.

Of course not, but they may not be so low.

The bitterness, the desire for just someone to care enough to talk to you about what you feel, and the realization that you dont think anyone will. Ive felt those things, they are nasty feelings that dont just go away. Feeling guilt already makes you a better person then most. It means you feel actual empathy, if you can find the courage to go out and try to make some friends again. Im sure they will love you because people who can feel true empathy are hard to come by.

They don’t realize you are depressed because they don’t know anything or understand about depression.

"Hey happy birthday, mang! I turned 21 in the beginning of February, and let me say AMEN! We're in a weird age, all those movies/TV/parents/etc. that say how strange and weird your 20's are, and how you have to go and FiND YoUr SeLf, are saying it for a reason. And I bet you've done plenty with your life, and if you haven't you sure can. I graduated highschool with a 2.1 GPA, did nightschool my senior year so I could manage mcdonalds and sell pot. All of this lead me to community college, where I just wrapped up getting my associate's and am on track for even further career progression.

Make no mistake, I don't say all this to brag or flex *my* achievements; no, no, no, I'd much rather offer my story for motivation. 

I came from nothing and was convinced I *was* nothing. I never succeeded in school or any social capacity. I wasn't horribly disturbing to be around, just dull and enough below average to be worthless (in my eyes, idk how the world felt about small me). I had plans to kill myself before reaching the age I'm at now, and just floated through adolescence waiting for an ""untimely"" death. I didn't find it. I instead found pot, and the joys of abusing it. I didn't magically want to live now, I was just too numbed to want death as much, distracted is a better word really. I got into a seriously unhealthy relationship, and began to sell weed around town and manage at a local mcdonalds I had been on and off working at throughout highschool. Senior year rolled around and I attended nightschool to make more room for working and selling. At this point my siblings had moved out (I'm the youngest) and it was just my very ill and downward spiraling mother, who was always gone, and I. I graduated, and got cheated on which launched me down a horrible, horrible rabbit hole for a long time. With my horrible GPA, no achievements, and a pretty lack luster desire to keep living, I enrolled at community college.

Took all of the 2.5 school years I was there to figure my shit out. I ended up smoking more pot, doing a bunch of adderall, dropping a bunch of acid, and even picked up smoking cigarettes to boot! I continued to be a nobody. I almost dropped out countless times, I failed two classes (that I paid a lot of money to take), and let people use the shit out of me for whatever they wanted. It got ugly, I got actively more and more suicidal and pretty much cut off contact with the little family and friends I had from home. 

I sucked it up and finished though. It's an assocaite's from CC, but goddamn if that isn't something I'm extremely proud of. There was no light switch flipping moment, but over that course of time I was exposed to people that were greater and lesser than me in everyway, I met people with multiple masters degrees that had things named after them, I met people with kids and a mortgage trying to go back to school, I saw people under the same self given pressure to find meaning that I had put myself under, and I saw people who truly embodied the definition of the word aloof. The stories and motivation I witnessed. I guess eventually I just realized ""yeah, maybe no one *does* care about me, and maybe I *am* insignificant and small, but I have wants and needs and dreams, and I'm tired of pushing them down inside myself to make room for the rest of the world to live in there instead. I stopped caring. I let myself wear PJ's to the caf, I let myself be wrong in conversation/arguments, I shut my mouth and opened my ears both spiritually and physically in real life, and alas, here I am. I still don't have much accomplished if you really want me to break it down, but I know what I *will* have accomplished and that feels pretty great. 

Sorry for the wall, but boy do I feel ya

tl;dr: Allowing yourself to *be* that nobody and *not* have those accomplishments comes first. Figure out why that upsets you, and then how it connects to what would make you (feel) whole, and bridge the gap homie. Accept the messy and weird and things will be far less messy and weird.

I lashed out at everyone around me, probably making the situation several times worse but for a moment I felt alive again I felt angry at the world rather than numb to it. I’m not saying to do this but I used my anger to prove the world wrong that it couldn’t just keep hitting me down over and over again.

I find that feeling happens to me before a depressive episode, almost like my method of blocking out other people and keeping my emotions to myself. It’s not fun to say the least. Conversation usually helps to get rid of the hollow feeling for me. Though, if you have actual dissociation disorder, I’m unfamiliar with it.",Depressed
"Yep, definitely. The solution is probably to explore and find something you like.",Depressed
Yes I feel this way all the fucking time!! I’ve had some trauma dealing with sexual assault that has led me to shove down my emotions and make myself feel like I was to blame for what happened to me. I feel so numb all the time and I don’t know anything about who I am or what I want. I don’t allow myself to feel anything and whenever I feel something my mind immediately rejects it because I’m so used to feeling numb.,Depressed
"There was a time I felt completely numb emotionally, felt like I wasn’t in control of my own life. No motivation. Felt like nothing was real. One day I just felt like I was drowning, or buried alive fighting for air. It was overwhelming and it made me feel like something HAD to change. I had a bucket of problems I hadn’t addressed for so long and I was finally somewhat self aware, I just took the most pressing of those problems and worked on it until it was solved and I felt like a weight was lifted. Afterwards I asked myself “why didn’t I just do this sooner?” All it took was for me to confront my problems one at a time and just try. Ever since I’ve worked on one problem at a time, paced myself, and slowly felt better over time. I had to genuinely want better for myself, and I had to be the one to make that decision. If nothing else just don’t give up, that’s the biggest thing",Depressed

I also blame myself for the stuff that's happened in the past and I probably will for the rest of my life but I know I can't change it.

"I also hate myself, even though some things are just out of my hands or not my fault I still feel like I could’ve and should’ve did something different. Anything at all and maybe my life would be better and I’d be further along by now. But I recently started looking back and feel like it couldn’t have gone different. As if everything played out the only way it was going to. I didn’t have the answers then, I couldn’t have known how I’d feel and think years later after finally gaining some clarity, and even if someone laid it out right in front of me back then I probably wouldn’t have understood or even cared. And even though I understand this, I still hate myself. I know dwelling on the past does nothing but make me feel worse and waste more time. I’m trying to turn that feeling into something productive, with the lessons I’ve learned, to get my life back on track. Progress is slow but the closer I get to a goal the more self forgiveness and confidence I feel, and slowly I start to believe in myself which motivates me to press on. Almost as if I had to suffer to make me who I am today, a better me. And maybe if I fully achieve my goals this self hate will fade entirely and I can feel proud again. I don’t know if this is something that could be of help to you, just remember you’re not alone",Depressed

It doesn't help when they try to cheer you up by the Bs "" don't worry be happy. Think positive and stuff like that"" 

The truth i know it is very hard, and if anyone says otherwise is just lying. The answers are not in suicide. You know what i have learned in those 7 years of depression?

There is a gap between who you are and who you want to be or at least who you wanted to be. That gape the bigger it gets the deeper we go into negativity and suicidal thoughts.

That's BS. But it's up to you to realize that.

The first thing we need to do is imagine that depression isn't actually a disorder or illness. Imagine that depression is a very clear message from a fully functional machine. What is that message saying? It's not saying to kill ourselves, friend. 

We're all going to interpret that message differently, but one thing has become very clear to me after a lifetime of living with it and searching for answers; we're not ill. And we're not supposed to kill ourselves. It's also possible we aren't meant to achieve the ""potential"" your friends and family talk about. Those of us who are depressed are here for a different reason entirely, and to realize that we first have to accept that our depression is not an illness. Then listen to what it's trying to tell us about life.",Depressed

"There is no right answer here. While you are his girlfriend, you are not married and are not necessarily responsible to be his second therapist at your personal expense. At the same time, you care about and love him and want him to feel better.

In your post, you make these two feelings contradictions to each other. When you spend your time to help him, you feel like you cannot spend time on yourself and your health. When you have too much time for yourself, you feel like you cannot help the person you love.

The reason why you're so confused is not because you're not able to understand or handle this situation: it's because you're in a position in which you can hardly help but be confused. Do not feel bad about this. 

In order to understand what you want to do, you need to think about what you want and what you value. One could argue that you cannot help your boyfriend if you can't help yourself first; another could argue that you should help your boyfriend because you love him and empathize with him. Think about what you want first, clear your confusion, and then perhaps you can figure out what you want to afterwards. Wish you the best.",Depressed
"It sounds to me like maybe you guys should sit down together and have a serious mental health talk, about how both of you guys feel and a plan moving forward about how to deal with how each of you are feeling.

"For a long time in my life I put others acceptance of me and others judgement of what I do and how I act far above mine, I still very much do sometimes, and that’s what’s hard. It’s just human nature to look for others opinions as a way to rank ourselves and to not feel at peace with ourselves until we please the crowd. For years I had a toxic relationship with my mother and my athletics, where I would allow myself to be bullied into practicing relentlessly and never feeling complete or good about myself, my skills, or how others perceived my talents because of the constant pressure that was set on me. I am just now starting to heal from that (me and my mom have come a long way together sense then) and although I am still somewhat concerned about the way people think about me (which is completely natural) I have found peace in the fact that I am the only critic that I should truly listen to, and if I find joy and happiness in something and I am happy about the way I perform, that is what matters. Because in my experience everyone is in a race to prove themselves to “the crowd” but the most peace and joy comes from when you can love yourself and say that although someone may not think you are the best, or love your work, you enjoying it and loving what you do is the only thing that really matters.

You love him, so maybe the best thing for him right now isn't the easiest. Explain to him the position you're in. Tell him you need to reserve some mental space and energy for yourself. Ask him to do tiny things- Small, easily achievable things- on the daily that will a) give him a little achievement of the day, and b) lighten the load for you. 

You could then gently amp it up if his confidence grows, and on the flip side, you could have that lie-in, mental-health-break time together, or intermittently. He needs you now, but equally you need him. Hope this helps.",Depressed

I recent broke up with my ex a few months ago cos she didn't give me any affection and she said she stopped loving.

From what I can see, these two statements are contradictory (but perhaps I'm missing something here). The separation and your depression seem directly linked here.

I could have had a great day, and have been genuinely happy, but then when I'm home, it's like being served a reality check.

It feels like hitting the ground after falling off a high building.    


It's like, bam! Splattered like fly. 


Feels like having someone's grip around my chest, and being squeezed-crushed till all the air inside your lungs is expelled.


Not trying to make you feel worse, but it's just that I can understand how you feel.


Sometimes the depression wants to have you believe that you're alone, in the middle of out-of-nowhere, far-removed from other people, different from them, less human, deprived of normalcy, no longer a man. 


I struggle hard, really hard with depression. Knowing that I'm not alone, somewhat makes the journey less lonely, bearable. I do not feel like a freak.

" this post is dangerous. 

You turned mental illness into the haves and the have nots. Those who  mentally pick themselves up  and those who are too lazy or weak. Would you say the same to someone with cancer? Because both are sick. 

This is a subreddit full of extremely sad and often suicidal people. You’ve come into their/our  safe space and implied to extremely vulnerable people that depression is a state of mind. It is absolutely not. It’s a chemical imbalance. Trauma can also seriously make matters worse, or be the beginning of a new battle. 

So many people write about how awful they feel because they can’t snap out of it. They’re told to stop being dramatic, or to toughen up. They’re very often told to think positive! It’s offensive because it sounds like you’re accusing that person of wanting to be miserable. 

My point is not to change your opinions because I can’t be bothered. My point is that you came into a room full of people who already feel crazy, and validated that by telling them their depression is a state of mind. 

There a lot more productive and compassionate ways to encourage people with mental illness to try harder. You can notes from the small victories people post about on this page. Taking showers, brushing your teeth, not crying for a day. Things like that are actually victories when you are deeply depressed. 

This post also gives more life to the stigmas surrounding mental illness. What’s wrong with being on meds?  Nothing. Absolutely nothing. What’s wrong with psychiatrist and therapist? Nada. Again- people in this subreddit are often extremely sad and suicidal. They need to talk to someone. They need help beyond what they can do for themselves currently and that is perfectly perfect. 

Becoming mentally & emotionally balanced is a life long job for people with serious mental health issues and trauma. Some people go years trying to get by on positive thoughts and just can’t. They need something more. They owe it to themselves to try all methods of management without judgement & categories. and as it’s a health issue, going to see medical professionals is rational. 

Again- I don’t care to change your opinion. I didn’t even want to write this because I hate long ass back and forth messages. But as someone who has been dealing with this for 26 years I could not be passive. People in here are fucking hurting. 

If you think you need help, get help. If that doesn’t help keep going and going. Let’s try any way we can think of. You’re worth it. You deserve to see how life can be when you’re stable. Don’t be ashamed of taking meds, you’re keeping yourself well. * what we need to hear *",Depressed

You’re not alone. I literally understand all of this. Although, I totally feel where you’re coming from and that you feel like your standards and what’re you’re looking for don’t exist.

They do exist. Trust me. I know it’s hard to believe, but there are people out there. And I forget that too a lot of times, because it’s so hard to find out there in the world.

But then I get on here and see posts like this, and I realize I’m not alone. And it makes me so happy and gives me hope. So, thank you for this.

Ngl, I have a lot of thoughts on this, just tired and am not the fastest typer, so this is all I have to say atm unfortunately lol. But if you ever need someone to talk to, I’m here for you.",Depressed
"Yo umm I’m all ears for you man! If you want to vent about anything I’m here for you. If it makes you feel better I’ll tell you about my problems too, we can bitch about life together if you want :)",Depressed
Yeah I miss trusting people. It sucks sometimes but hopefully I'll get it back,Depressed
"I feel you man. Luckily I have my english teacher, and my best friend sometimes. It's nice to have someone like that, I know. I really hope you will find someone too, maybe it's a person you would never expect, in fact I hated my teacher before we started talking. Good luck❤️",Depressed
"I can understand how you feel. Maybe it would be helpful to think about what trust means to you. In my opinion, trust is not *given*, it's *earned piece by piece* in time. Today you might only trust your friend to tell him that you're going to see a movie. In time, you might build your relationship to the point where you can share your deepest secrets and feel secure.",Depressed
"Well first off, Hello and I hope your having a good day so far. Secondly I'll state that unfortunately I dont know exactly how your feeling but i do understand your need for ultimate connection with one person who can true and endlessly love you, for you. Its extremely hard to find this without opening up completely yourself as well, anxiety makes things in this spectrum even more difficult as no matter what you do, you feel people are constantly judging you, even if you know subconsciously there not. That's the kicker in itself isn't it. I would ultimately suggest starting several, small, friendship like connections with people who you will never meet. Creating these minor bonds either though online chat rooms or social media gives you the chance to open up without the feeling of judgement as you can discontinue any conversation at ease which gives you more of feeling of control which is also something you desperately need as someone with anxiety. Give that a try and see if it helps you to open up more and soon with practice you might be able to connect with people easier face to face and then find that connection you so desperately want and need.",Depressed
"It's okay and not uncommon to have this desire in your heart of hearts. Sometimes we can find some fulfillment within or with our spiritual lives. At times, we may attract several friends who all together help us feel connected. It's certain rare to find it all in one other person. I think I found it one time but then it didn't last and neither of us protected what we had going. Remember, if you should find this, which you can, then enjoy it but know it's temporary. Hang on don't be mean to yourself just because you have a desire for deep connection.",Depressed

"There is a rule of thumb that people like to talk about themselves. What you need to find is someone who will listen. It doesn't matter who it is. It could be your family. But someone. Also, it would be look at why you think that you have to settle. No one ever has to settle.",Depressed
"Holy Shit! I relate to you so much mate. I was bullied like shit from 6-8th grades I got extreme social anxiety because of that also self worth issues. I can relate to not trusting people and closing off so much. I always tell my counselor that there's this big barrier between me and other people and I don't know what it is. It's just there. 
Whenever someone gets close or tries to that barrier doesn't break at all it stays and it's tough to get through, even I don't know how to break it even though I want to and be vulnerable. 

Idk if this helps you what I realised so far is that the barrier exists because I don't trust people to believe me and I can't trust myself to handle myself just in case I get hurt badly by things turning sour. Either way if it helps or not remember you aren't alone!",Depressed
"Are you making yourself available to listen sincerely to others? Are you offering genuine and absolute confidence for the private conversations you have with them?

Imho the best way to find someone with particular qualities is to embody them yourself. Live by them. In time, you will attract others with a similar world view.

And if not, you may find that having become a good listener and a highly trustworthy person, you have discovered the wide spectrum of incredible features that so many people have, and you may discover that the things you were once seeking specifically no longer feel so important.

Trust does not come immediately upon meeting someone. In time it can be earned, but it must be worked on - by both sides.",Depressed
"my friend has mental illness, serious one and I'm glad she trust me enough for her to tell me about all her struggle and her intrusive thoughts, but yeah it was a long journey, she didn't trust me at all and accuse me of liar at the beginning but I stick to her all in her bad period of time and she finally realize that I'm always by her side no matter how bad she become. It was hard for me too but I'm glad I did it :)

Listen bro. Life its like a labirith some times the road its all clear and straight you are doing good. Then you start getting lost and tricked. But don't give up! Keep trying you will find the exit from that labirith and continue your path. Any life path you get will always have a labirth in it and you have to get trough it to go on. You can find another way to get out of the labirith in different ways. Any of those exits of the labirith will bring you to another path that you will have to continue.

I feel the same.Living on is pointless, and dying is just as pointless. So, what I do is ponder. Think and think about anything that surrounds me, be it physical or psychological. Why? Because I wanted to be eternal, and observe everything that can be, not to get involved in anything, but just observe, from every angle, every perspective. I don't make sense either, but nothing made sense to me as I was growing up. So why should it make any more sense now. I think I have found what I really want, and it's just way out of reach.

"Honestly, sometimes it is best just to ask. Straight up. Sometimes, they will repeat the same answer and say they want to be alone but they aren't thinking clearly - speaking from my personal experiences. Sometimes the noise of the world, even people that care about us, can get a bit much so we decide 'being left alone' is our best option. The only problem with that is, we then beat ourselves up for pushing people away and are left alone with our thoughts.

With your friend, I wouldn't suggest calling out of the blue - that can make them anxious and they will just end up starting at the phone. Maybe send them a text asking if they'd like a phone call? Or send a text a couple of times a week just saying you're checking in - but don't make it sound like a chore. Use phrases like ""I hope you're well"" as opposed to ""how are you?"", sometimes it's better to let them say how they are feeling as opposed to leaving them an open ended question. 

Finally, in a phone call or text message, just remind them that no matter what you are there for them and also, the most important just say to them that when they do need you, you are there to listen or for a discussion. It is up to them what they want from a conversation. If that makes sense?",Depressed

The thing is, if you’ve never experienced depression you can’t understand it, and ignorant people, even our parents, will say ignorant shit. It hurts to be treated by your parents so dismissively. Since you can’t confide in your parents, this means you’ve got to take matters into your own hands and seek professional help. You can do it. In the meantime, don’t let ignorant  people try to dictate how you experience your own feelings.",Depressed

"Unfortunately I think being alone among people is a fact of life here, especially for those of us who feel acute depression. What brings people together is shared purpose, and most of us, especially in the western world, live pretty pointless lives of consumerism and self-enrichment in the end. Neither of which are conducive to building meaningful human connections.

I believe those of us who are depressed have forgotten our purpose. I've found that once I realized I had a purpose, I chose to be around people who  I could connect with. Before that, it was just an endless parade of disconnected and affected acquaintances, really.",Depressed

"Hello, I wanna share with you some of my journey that is similar to yours,   


I am from Morocco, when I was a kid, I've been bullied by my classmates, by my teachers and everyone, I still remember in my fifth grade, I just moved to another school, where everyone were fluent in French and I wasn't able to piece words, so my french teacher made me put both my index on my cheeks to prononce which obviously was her way to mock and have a laugh at my expanse, among many other things, I grew up hating french as a language and hating studies for good.   


I have been told that I'm stupid, that I'm a worthless piece of shit, that i will never make it to high school. years went by, then Bam I had depression by the age of 19/20 a 7 years of depression and 3 suicidal attempts. the first year, I spent it on my own bed, I didn't leave my room for one Year, can you imagine it? it was a very painful experience, and everyday I was wishing it will be the last one.   


  
My self-confidence and self-esteem decreased while my self-hatred grew every day. I hated myself more and more. thinking and believing that I'm not worth because I've been told so.   


During my early phase of depression, I become an atheist, in a religious country, so let me share with you just  things I've been told those times :   
1) God is punishing you   
2) This is god's Wrath for becoming an Atheist  
3) Pray and you'll be fine.  


Some others will say, don't worry be happy, it's like I have a button to turn on and off how I'm feeling, and all that Bs about it, the truth is, it doesn't work.   


Rome, Wasn't built overnight, Everything great takes a long time, life is not a race, it's a marathon, when you are running a marathon you don't stop when you feel like stopping, you stop when you are done, same goes for life. Feeling shit about yourself, is part of life, do you know what it means? it means  your future self is asking you to evolve and grow, here is the thing ( this is just my own observation) Depression is a gap between who you are and who you want to be, a fight between your present person and your future person.  


The fight is not over until you decide, and I'm pretty sure you are smart to know that you'll win this fight as long as you don't stop.  


Ps : You really are super cute and gorgeous, and girl. the moment you start realizing it, things will start changing, and if i can give you an advice, don't date a guy who wants to date you for your look, date a guy, who wants to date you for mind, your smile. because that's the real deal.

When I began getting that help, I also began removing things from my life that cluttered my sense of freedom and control. The point for me, was to have some semblance of a say in my life and how I felt. It got better for me and I worked hard, and continue to, in order to keep it better.

I don't want to return to do it all again... Do you? The first thing I had to do was accept that it's fully legitimate to not want to return. It's not a mental illness or something that needs to be disguised and ignored by medicine. It's a genuine realisation that life is pain and suffering, and that we are lost here in life. And when we are lost, what would we do? We'd find our way home. We want to go home. That's all. But you won't get there by curling up and wishing for it. We have to get out and find the path.

"Currently I am also having a depression and suicidal thoughts so I don't know if there is light at the end of the tunnel actually I don't think there is but what I do know is that before you take any action or do something that might kill you, you have to ask yourself; do I want to be dead or do I not want to feel like this? 

Because maybe death takes away all the awful feelings, which I personally know they suck, but death takes a lot more away. One of those things is the potential to get better.",Depressed

I know this is very stereotypical but I'll tell you your life's worth a lot, every part of it and trust me there will be a day you'll realise it and you'll also realise that you're precious to people in your life.

"I can't tell you if it's right or wrong as I believe a honesty is the most important thing and a promise made should be kept. I still keep a promise made to someone who literally stabbed me in the stomach trying to kill me (I promised to always help them out with whatever they needed from money to advise as long as they never lied to me).

What I can say though is that it's human nature to put oneself first, humans are by nature greedy and self entitled.

 A favourite quote of mine is ""Those who know nothing out peace have different ideals to those who know nothing but war"". Good and bad, right and wrong are all subjective and a form of brain washing through society.
Animals such as rodents and cats don't think about good or bad, right or wrong, they just act to survive or satisfy their instincts. Dolphins, who are believed to have higher intelligence then humans, only act to survive or satisfy their instincts, after all they gang rape every species from whales and sharks to humans. Humans are the only animals that believe in ""good/bad or right/wrong"".

You could ask 100 people this question and 59 would tell you, your right to ignore this person to preserve your mental health but 41 would tell you, your wrong to ignore them and you need to keep your promise.

In the end no-one can tell you whether you are right or wrong because as I said humans are selfish if someone told you you were good to ignore this person there and you decide to continue helping this person because of it there could be a place in the corner of your mind that disagrees that ignoring them makes you bad so you'll just be tearing yourself up or vice versa.

Long story short no-one can tell you, you gotta decide for yourself, one way or another people are going to judge you based on whichever decision you make, whether they are vocal about it or not is another story. You've just gotta make a decision that matches your own desires the most.",Depressed

We have shitty days and that is okay. You're allowed to feel shitty. Just as you'll feel positive and that is something you do not need to force. If you try to force positivity, you'll only be more angry and annoyed at yourself when you don't reach that goal. Be motivated and willing to have positivity experiences and they will come naturally - the good times can't be forced but steps can be taken to achieve them.

That feeling you're experiencing right now is super important. It means that, internally, you still *really* care. You need to latch onto that feeling with your life, and make that propel you into doing something about your situation.

I was born in 1993 and have been living my whole life with depressive issues.  In 2015 I asked my doctor to be on anti-depressants and they prescribed Sertraline.  In 2016 I went to another doctor and told them that I thought Sertraline didn't do anything and I wanted to try something else.  They recommended Trintellix and I tried it.  I thought it was helping me even though I'd still get depressed so I kept taking it but a few months later I got my first ever suicidal thought.  Kept taking it and a few months later I'm planning my death.  Around July/August of 2017 I was still taking Trintellix and I felt as though I was two weeks away from taking my life.  I was severely depressed and in a total state of Hell.
I stop taking Trintellix because it finally occurs to me that the medication is not working for me.  I stopped taking any anti-depressant for another year.  Another year of severe depression and then in July 2018 I tried Sertraline again and it took me out of Hell.  For the first time in my entire life I felt seriously well and I wasn't depressed every single day.
I'm still on a low dose of Sertraline and I'm working on fixing my life so I can get off this medication and still never be depressed.",Depressed
"Depression is a complicated thing that is not 100% understood yet, but to answer your question, yes, people do recover from depression. It's all about learning how to manage your symptoms (a process that is different for everyone) and knowing how to keep the symptoms away. Understand that it's IMPOSSIBLE to be 100% happy all your life, and you shouldn't expect that from yourself. However, it also isn't normal to be unhappy all the time, which is what depression is. Remember, you yourself are not your depression. Depression is an illness, and something that has to be treated. Something interesting to know about depression that was recently discovered is that the brain works like a muscle, and what i mean by that is that the more depressive thoughts the brain has, the better it gets at staying depressed. ALSO, the more positive thoughts the brain has, the better it is at staying positive. Part of getting out of depression is retraining your brain to be more possitive, and this can be accomplished with medication, but most importantly with life-style changes. For me, I've been having to retrain my brain to be more positive rather than negative. For me, this looks like meditating everyday, paying attention to my negative thoughts, challenging their logic, and replacing them with more positive ones. The most important thing you can do to yourself is to be KIND and GENTLE with yourself. Treat yourself like a friend. Would you ever tell your friend that their worthless, that their better off dead, that their not worth the time? I sure hope not. Every person is valuable because of the fact that their alive and here now. Be kind to yourself and others, and hold onto hope, because the world is an interesting place where anything can happen. Probably the most important thing to remember is that recovery takes time and a lot of it. You have to be patient, you will not see overnight results. Also, recovery is not linear, there will be good days, bad days, good weeks, bad weeks, etc., but overall there is progression. There's lots of tips online to help you recover, you're never alone in your struggles. A therapist is VERY helpful, and never be afraid to try medicine. I know this was long but I hope it helps, people do recover.",Depressed

""why are you so unhappy"" "" you never smile"" it just made me feel worse. but one day i had enough and made the scary decision to accept loneliness. i started to sit alone at school and they all started to criticize me about how i was being rude by ignoring them and it just confused me. how was I the rude one now?? but i later found new friends ( a small group) who would let me have fun again. just trust me when i say that loneliness is scary at first but sometimes taking the leap can be the best thing for you. change may be hard at first but distancing yourself from toxicity is super important. the fact that they make you feel like you aren't good enough is terrible and i used to feel the same way with my friends. i hope you know that you aren't alone and i hope that you will find someone that will make you feel happy again one day",Depressed
same here. if u wanna talk i can help man.,Depressed
I have same thogihts ..obviously it is the depression lying to us but those thoughts are input head so we tend to believe it no question.nobody knows what future will bring. There are many people who cured depression once and for all..but it is so hard to see hope when you felt like this for a long time. Are you in therapy? Taking meds?,Depressed
"I'm sorry this world is so fucked up right now. I wish you weren't in so much pain. Everything is upside down. I don't know your circumstances but if your depressed the world isn't making it better right now. 

Be kind to yourself. Just do what you can each day. Get up, keep moving, do something you know that brought you joy in the past that is easy to do right now... listen to music? Watch movies? Draw... anything small. 

Smoking sucks. I did it for many years. Its gross. Ruins your teeth and lungs permanently even if you don't get cancer or emphysema. Plus dying struggling to breathe and slowly dying over a long period of time from lung cancer is possibly one of the worst ways to suffer. You don't want that. No one deserves that or wants that way out.

You just want to stop hurting.

Of course. It hurts. Sometimes when we hurt so bad we stop talking to people around us because we are affraid we will hurt them. Or maybe they won't care or understand. We then start to isolate and get all alone in our own thoughts where our ""sick brain"" tells us our only way out is to leave this world. (Our brain is sick because it's sad and depressed and telling us bad untrue things). But when we feel very down we need to share the most. Spend time with friends. Socialize. Even if it's only online. But face to face or over the phone is always better.

Try to get out of your funk and go do something different. The ""smoke"" means you want adventure! You need excitement. Your soul and mind and spirit are bored. It's not the smoke you want or the alcohol it's a new experience that is exciting because it's new.

You can make that happen. Today. Right now. This moment. Set down the phone and do something you've never done before. Run outside and scream like a maniac and beat your chest. Jog to your friends house. Call someone and tell them you've had a crush on them forever but could never tell them because you were always too affraid (and it's ok however they respond... it's the fact you were brave enough to take that adventure is what matters - you grew)

Anything new. It could even be go cook something crazy you never had before poptart with spaghettios sandwich? Uh, yes please. Whatever can make you laugh. And if someone else laughs with you or even at you it's working.

Oh, but adventurous doesn't mean dangerous or lawless or disrespectful. Just have fun. Try to.

I know it's very very hard to. Especially right now. And especially even more so if you suffer from depression. 

But keep trying. Life can change for the better in an instant.

Hang in there. Be true to yourself. Be kind and patient to yourself as much as needed, too.

Not everyone can handle these conversation. I have a few friends that I can talk about my depression with but some of them never know what to say or it makes them feel awful.

It can be hard for people to know what to say in such a moment. I suggest you try to say it again to her and if she changes subject again, say how you feel about her changing the subject, after you explained that to her she probably understands a bit more how she has to act when you try to talk about how you feel",Depressed

If it's possible, i'd recommend trying again like other people did, maybe expressing what happened and how it made you feel in writing instead of live conversation. It will give your friend more time and agency to collect themselves and consider what to say in return. In general, writing became my preferred method to initiate this type of conversation with people, it helps talking the necessary time to find how to handle those conversations together.",Depressed

"Hey there, that sounds incredibly rough and I'm sorry you're hurting. I've never experienced something quite like that before so I couldn't imagine how that feels. 

I don't know if this would be helpful to hear- but I've spoken with some friends who have been the ""friend"" in your situation. They told me that it's not that they thought less of the person- but that it was too hard to look into the face of other people's demons when they were so tired of fighting their own. It's easier to change the subject and avoid the really hard and scary thing that you can't predict.",Depressed
"They :
1. Probably got uncomfortable and we’re afraid they weren’t going to say the right thing so they tried to walk their way out of the conversation. In my opinion, while it’s understandable that they may feel uncomfortable, I think it’s a dick move. I’ve been there before and it’s almost like I would prefer for them to tear me down for being depressed and try to devalidate everything I just said, over them straight up ignoring
2. Might not be a good friend; I know it’s hard finding friends when you’re depressed. Hell, its hard finding friends when you’re on top of the world. And It always upsets me when I find out that a lot of the people I find friends don’t honestly feel the same towards me. So many friendships these days are platonic and the word friend has honestly lost all meaning. You’re “friends” with strangers on facebook, you’re “friends” with co-workers you’ve barely ever been around, etc. And the word honestly just confuses the hell out of me

Also I know this may sound like the most generic line ever, but seriously, if you ever need to talk, do not hesitate to message me. I know we don’t know each other that well, but I relate so much to this. I used to be majorly depressed and suicidal, i’ve come a long way since then, and while I still am kind of depressed I am no longer suicidal or in a dark place.

"I think talking to friends is incredibly important to help deal with mental health issues however I think we need to understand the weight of what we are tossing onto our loved ones. It’s takes empathy and understanding to know what those around us are able to take on. So as much as you may want to dump your heart out onto your best friend’s lap, maybe they aren’t ready for everything you have to say. Maybe they need  to be eased in. Maybe they have a lot of their own shit going on and what you have to say only reminds them of their issues and is too much for them to handle. Maybe they just don’t relate at all and know they’d be of no help. We need to pay attention to the people around us, find out where they are mentally and be open with them. Before saying “hey I feel really depressed all the time and am constantly thinking about killing myself.”
Try letting them know you have a lot going on emotionally and asking if it’s cool for you to get into it. Let them know you need someone to talk to and you hope they are up for it but if not that’s okay. 
Just because you are drowning in pain does not entitle you to someone else’s attention. No one owes us anything. Everything is give and take. And we build stronger relationships when we consider and accept how others feel. I am truly sorry you are going through hell right now. There are people out there willing to listen.

"What's worth living for is different from person to person. For me, it's family, going to the movie theater and spending time with people I care about, getting excited for the comic books that are coming in the mail next month. It's hard to focus on what's worth living for when the thoughts are so loud though.

That feeling will begin to manifest into something bigger over time and help you to bring that light into other things in your life. Everything that we feel or do either brings us wanted or unwanted feelings but each different emotion shapes our live differently and for the better. It's what will create you, the best you, someone you'll be proud of and honestly your the only one who will love you with true unconditional love.

"Hello :)  
It is very awesome you have managed to figure out your signs of a breakdown. Your signs and the breakdown itself are intense times so organising those times coherently like this is difficult.  


When you self harm often it isn't helpful to see yourself as - I have been clean for so a certain amount of time. You must give yourself a timeframe for example 2020 and look at how much you have self harmed and try to set yourself goals on how much you wan't to try and stay under. If you stay under it thats amazing, if you only just stay under it, thats amazing because you fought very hard often. If you smash the goal and stay well under it, thats amazing too because your coping mechanisms have worked!  


As for avoiding self harm my methods are distraction or replacing it with something else.  
I love browsing reddit so when I feel intense urges I do that and listen to music in my headphones. I sometimes punch my pillow if I need a immediate release.  


It seems all these things are happening because of something in your life and you must find a way to improve your comfort with that first before you can more easily cope with your current issues.

"Experience with 2, 3, 5, and 7.

Feel like  reached a breakdown phase as well.

For 2 and 3,  recommendation would be to do exactly what you did - reach out. Proud of you for doing so! That seemed to work best for  in a situation that is somewhat relatable. Upon reaching out, others were able to help  identify hope in life, which helped to ease the pain and bring  back into a state of normalcy.

Maybe finding hope in your life could help to bring you back to a state of normalcy as well. Sometimes this hope may be hard to see, but  promise it’s there. Help to find it - please feel free to reach out,  am here for you.

For 5, (this is not meant to come across as patronizing) perhaps wearing a watch, if available, could help you to track time. Or if you wanted to keep track of the amount of time utilized for specific tasks, using a stopwatch function on your phone may be helpful.

For 7, how is your diet? (Not a dietician) but the lack of proper nourishment could lead to these effects. For , lack of proper hydration when  was experiencing these feelings was likely a large factor in exacerbating their effects. Second to that, a lack of appetite, which led to a breakdown of the necessary nutritional compounds that  typically receive from food made this snowball even further. If you too feel like you’ve lost your appetite, (remember not a dietician) perhaps taking a multivitamin could help to stabilize your body’s nutritional deficiencies (if there are any) and mitigate these effects until you are able to continue with a normal, balanced diet.

Again, if there is anything that  can do you help you, please feel free to reach out.",Depressed

Now, if I were to tell people I believe nothing matters, they're gonna think I'm pretty dark, but I know myself that it was... way worse before. So when I think of my mental health I try to stick to relativity. As for lost opportunities, acknowledging that they're lost is an important first step to actually going for them, if that makes sense?

"Hm.. That's a really good question. I mean, I agree with you 100%. I believe we are truly alone. I also think that my degree of empathy is abnormal (and I'd really like to be without it at times). I don't think *anyone* in my life cares about me to the same extent that I care about them. But if it's normal or healthy to think like this, I have no idea. I don't think I believe this just because of my depression, but I guess there's no way I can really know. 

Sorry I couldn't really answer your question, though.",Depressed

That’s kind of why I’m questioning if that feeling is healthy or not. It’s very useful when I need to be strong and deal with difficult situations head on, but when I’m sitting here thinking about my relationships and life I feel like I shouldn’t feel so lonely.

George Washington didn't get to decide to live during a historic, revolutionary era. None in history do. They simply take on the mantle of their forefathers to try to lead us and our future into a better direction.

We weren't meant live like this, separated from friends and family, under constant stress and working more hours per week than hunter gatherers had to to survive. We evolved in close-knit tribes of high double to low triple digits. This is what the psyche finds validating and preferable. Being constantly surrounded by strangers while constantly separated from friends and family, only being able to see them a few days out of the week at most, is not something the psyche is quite capable to deal with for extended periods of time without something going wrong.

Don't tell her anything that would invalidate her pain. My parents told mw for years that i have nothing to be depressed about and it fucked me up, making me avoid getting help. (I actually turned out to be bipolar, which is something i cant help and will live with for the rest of my life.) 

Don't treat her like she will snap at any moment, don't treat her like shes weak and cant handle herself. My parents did that after i got back. It made me feel alienated and just out of place in my own house.

Support her but don't bombard her, and allow her to have space but don't let her spend all day alone. 

You obviously care for your daughter. Remind her that you love her and that you are there to talk to. Maybe give her a speacial present or something.

Therapy is there to help you work though your problems not for someone to validate ho you are. Your therapist is under regulations, same as a doctor. If you wish to speak freely without your parents knowing about what you discuss with him/her that is your right as a human being. If you want to talk openly without judgement that's what they are there for and all you need to say before your session is that you require them to keep this between just the two of you. You need to have a trust between your therapist and yourself or you'll never be able to freely talk to them about anything as you'll always feel like your being betrayed. This is why it has not been helping and in fact making it worse. You have every right to refuse to speak to someone you dont connect with, like stated before they are there for you, not the other way around. You feelings my dear a valid and you should never ever push them aside or think you'll disappoint anyone or anything. If someone cant handle your feelings then they dont deserve you.

"The problem that some might see (not necessarily me) with this mentality is that it promotes happiness without cognition or purpose. Understanding that happiness and locating where that happiness comes from becomes an incredibly difficult exercise when we are happy without being able to think about why. 

There's a lot of philosophical literature (Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, for example) on this dichotomy, and a common theme in this literature is: is unconscious happiness actually happiness? We are different from other organisms because we find happiness as more than just a series of chemical reactions in the brain, like most animals do. We attach meaning to that happiness when we cognize about happiness, and it therefore becomes all the more conscious and ""real"" instead of superficial.

"I understand the pain. I feel the exact same way. If it weren't for the fact that I have zero chance of ever affecting change in the world, I'd want to know as much as I could to make the best possible choices. I did this all my life, constantly trying to expand the keyhole through which I view life. After I learned what the world was truly like, how nobody in charge does a goddamn thing competently and we are right on the edge of the cliff as a species and a planet and yet we as a society still have no direction, so we'll just infight, wasting resources and time until there's no more cliff to stand on.

I want our species to survive, for life, consciousness, and intelligence to live on. I want us to achieve immortality among the stars. But the wider I open my eyes and the longer they stay open, the more it looks like the rich and powerful leading the poor off a cliff, squashing all forward social progress in the name of GREED! Not even just people trying to take to survive, it's people taking because they feel they don't have enough. It's sickening. They let tens of thousands of people starve daily so they can shit on a toilet made of opal and gold.

And the rest of us poor get squashed under the roiling wheels of capitalism. The concept of money and capitalism is that you earn enough money which can be saved and theoretically used to expand your monetary horizons, improving your quality of life. It replaced sharecropping, where people would work for food and water and/or shelter. So what happens when you get paid just barely enough to survive but not enough to enjoy life or have any chance of getting out of your situation? You are a modern serf. A mere tool for the rich. What do you think is going to happen to the mass of useless populus once robots start taking our jobs and they get us on UBI? The entire reason capitalism works is because the one thing you have to sell to capitalists (besides the product if your labour if you're a tradesman) is that you have labour (time) to sell to capitalists so you can make their product better and faster than they would otherwise. If you have no labour to sell, if the mass of humanity has no labour to sell, why are you still alive, breathing all the precious air, drinking all the precious freshwater, eating all the precious food? The only thing keeping you alive at that point would be money taxed from the rich, and if they're willing to let people fall into the gears of capitalism and get mercilessly ground into paste on the daily just to have a couple hundred bucks worth of product, I'm sure it won't be a problem in the future.

Not to mention climate change, the abhorrently massive amount of plastic pollution, the degredation of the nitrogen cycle in our industrial farmlands likely leading to mass famine, how we enslave children for their lifetime to make clothing and technology for hours on end in sweatshop factories where they have to install nets to keep them from killing themselves, how millions are starving yet we waste twice as much food as it would take to feed the entire human population every single day.

Why be alive if your species is blindly walking off a cliff and there's nothing you can do about it. When they won't even listen to reason. When all your existence will amount to is slaving away your freedom and happiness for some rich fuck who doesn't even know you exist.

Fuck this shit. And what's worse is I am fully aware of exactly how stupid I am, how little I truly know, and yet I seem to understand leagues more than at least 60% of the human race. It must be so, otherwise HOW THE EVER LOVING FUCK ARE WE IN OUR CURRENT SITUATION AS A SOCIETY? I am not content to merely be a cog in your machine. Give me liberty or give me death, because if no liberty is given, I'd gladly choose death. Yet that is exactly what we'll all be if automation takes our only purpose to those in power. Dead.

It’s just not the same. I don’t think people realize how debilitating depression can be.,Depressed
You forget to mention those chronic pain and suicidal thought.,Depressed
"But for some people depression can also be sadness and crying, it really depends on the person",Depressed
"If I could cry, I would. If I could cry, I sure would..",Depressed
"I wished I cried more. It’s better than feeling so emotionally hollow. I feel nothing, and feel like nothing. I know people experience depression differently, but for me, crying would at least be something.",Depressed
i wanna be more motivated but idk how to,Depressed
"Love when you confide in people and they tell you “Oh you’re not depressed” 

Fucking FUCK YOU. It’s so awesome you know me better than I know myself, thanks for letting me know I’m just a fucking liar in your eyes. 

And when you call them out for calling you a liar you get bullshit “that’s not what I meant, I just think you don’t know what you’re talking about” excuses. 

People act like I should be fucking HAPPY that they’ve just fucking decided I don’t have depression. Like I should be grateful that they’ve unearthed this big mystery of “oh you don’t have that, isn’t that nice for you!”",Depressed
"My depression & suicidal thoughts began about 6 yrs old. I didn't cry (even if in my room)  because if dad heard me, ""I'll give you something worth crying about"" <and he would>. To quote, ""Only wusses blubber. Suck it up"" 
By 9ish, didn't matter what my feels were inside, outside was a blank, flat affect. There were no ""happy"", ""sad"", ""lonely"", ""afraid""; ""frustrated/angry"" tears. I was trained well that they served no purpose.
[Note: I internally rejected the message, despite what it was needful I had to do to survive]
It wasn't until my mid 40's before I was granted the gift to be able to cry again. It's still rare though.",Depressed
"I slept 16 hours last night. I'm missing big chunks of life, but I still went on a walk and reached out to a friend. I don't know what else to do except try to be grateful for a new day and at least involve some joy in my doings. Good luck and better days to you.",Depressed
"100% this. Since becoming depressed (before and after being diagnosed) I hardly ever cry, and I used to all the time as a kid. I'm too numb and sick and tired to cry, and even on the occasional break down I can't really shed more than a few tears. Meanwhile, I've gone through every symptom of depression like I'm winning monopoly: over and under-eating, messy room, over and undersleeping. It's funny how people treat depression like upgraded sadness when it's really more like upgraded tiredness with extra emotional instability than anything.",Depressed
"Thank God im not the only one who just feels empty, i dont cry (very rare)",Depressed
"You are so right about crying. I suffered a major ""mental health crisis"" about five years ago, and didn't shed a tear until about six months ago. That's when I knew I was getting a little bit better. I felt an emotion, rather than just totally numb.

When I was younger (I'm now in my 60s and have been depressed all my life, with anxiety too), I do think I cried more during more serious episodes (when things were worse than the usual low-grade life). 

I think you are on target to note that it can be really different for different people. 

I've had to change the way I think about this. I used to feel like I had ""lost so much of life"" and now I remind myself that ""this is my life, as it is.""",Depressed
"I have these days where it gets really bad and my whole body just physically gets numb and I feel like I'm not even living, but I'm just floating through the day. Then some days ill laugh and feel like I shouldn't because I don't deserve to be happy. It's just hard to deal with because some of my friends have it and I talk about it with them but I can't talk to my parents about it because they just think of depression as a temporary sadness and don't take it seriously. It's so annoying that people think that depression is linked with crying because I haven't been able to cry in a long time. It just invalidates the person's feelings because they aren't ""crying"".",Depressed
I always felt like my depression made me numb to emotions. Eventually my body just seems to react and force me to cry when I haven't done it in a few months but mostly I just feel numb.,Depressed
Depression is your best friend,Depressed
"Depression is despair of the soul. It is felt by those of us who can see past the superficialities of the default life, and who need an answer beyond ""work, consume, proliferate"". Depression is completely misunderstood, friend. You are so right. 

I'd love to discuss more with you.",Depressed
"Do you explore it though? If your depression is a message, who is sending it and what are they saying? 

If it's a phone call, you keep answering and then hanging up without saying anything, you're not listening to the caller. Right? What are they saying?",Depressed
I feel you. 💕,Depressed
"Do you have any hobbies? Although this is a little unrealistic for the times right now, but post-quarantine looking for social groups around common interests is a great way to make friends. Wish you the best of luck.",Depressed
Same I’m a-little behind on my timeline so most my friends are gone and the hobbies I enjoy I haven’t made any real friends in yet,Depressed
I can be your friend!,Depressed
"I would recommend you participate in some hobbies, but hobbies - even ones you really enjoy - will become mundane and boring without friends. But perhaps some sort of activity/hobby might lead to some group you can be with. 

Unfortunately, I don't have the slightest clue as to whatever activity that might be - otherwise, I would be doing it, too. The only, slightly-helpful idea I have is video games, but that can be expensive and unhealthy in long doses. 

I guess knitting or origami might suffice. Honestly, I'm sorry I can't give you any good ideas.",Depressed

"Come to India, friend. I left America in 2004 and built a wonderful life in India and never looked back. We're all the same under all the bullshit, we just need to get away and shake things up and the meaning of it all opens up.",Depressed
"That's also how my childhood was + abusive family. I got depressed, messed up school and it all became a slippery slope from there. I got a shitty job and moved out as soon as I could.
When I was 24 (moved out at 17 so it took me 7 years to figure this out) I started realising nothing will get better if I don't do anything about it. I went back to school, got a degree, got a better job and I went from renting a room to renting my own apartment. 
I'm 30 now, still scarred from the past (working on that), but I'm living a decent live now. In all honesty I do keep to myself more than I probably should but I have pets to keep me company. 

Don't let your childhood define the rest of your life, work towards making it better for yourself. I know it's hard to stay positive in a shitty situation but don't waste 7 years like I did.",Depressed
Other people aren't that important. Have you ever thought about just buying a one way ticket to another country for awhile? Taking a break? That'll put life into perspective and give you something to be proud of.,Depressed
"That's funny. When I told my dad I was flying to India at the dinner table he said ""You'll die!"" Lol. I'll never forget that. I didn't die in the way he feared, but I was reborn. And I never left. I'm here now, in lockdown in a place called Bhimtal. Get away and find yourself.  It will help. I'd be happy to welcome you over here of you make it this way. Its very accessible and super cheap.",Depressed
Make it happen man. Magical things happen when you get away. Leaving America when I was about your age was the best decision I ever made.,Depressed
I loved it. I didn't have to deal with Americans (my people) and all their expectations and bullshit. Every day it was a new experience. Choose a cheaper country where you can afford 1-2 years of carefree existence. It's a lot cheaper of you go off the path and meet locals.,Depressed
"So it depends where you go in India. If you go into the mountains you can rent out a room for $50 to $100 per month, sometimes even less. You're living simple, in a village, but it's rewarding. The cities are a lot more, but they're dirty and not very appealing. I started in a place called Kasaar Devi - my rent back then was about 1500 rupees, which was about $30. I lived for 4 years with no problem. 

India attracts cool people, free spirits - that's the best part. And when you need to renew your visa you can cross into Nepal and come back. There's craziness here, but that's part of the appeal of it all. I was so bored in America, and still am when I go back. So routine. India shakes it all up, and so long as you can figure out how to manage a few thousand dollars a year you can really kick off yours shoes here and find something in yourself, some reason to keep going.",Depressed
"For 30k usd you can live a really long time. The key is to get in and find a place and get wise. Never tell anyone here how much you have, always negotiate, and never act like you have money.

There's real freedom. No one breathing down your neck.",Depressed

I had 10k saved and I lived very comfortably for 4 years with a motorcycle and plenty of travel. When I left and returned I started a software company and then everything just got easier as the company did well. Now I've stepped back from that and just live in the mountains with my dog and partner. Simple life surrounded by incredible beauty. Depression happens, but I have enough time to continue to work through it. I don't have to work a shitty 9 to 5 job to put food on the table. That's so important.

I would suggest finding a new therapist. It’s important to understand that we can be paired with a therapist that doesn’t t fit our personality. Remember they are people too and they have things going on in their lives that may be keeping them from connecting with you. I would recommend doing this sooner than later. If you can’t get in with a new therapist quickly find a local person in your faith community and ask if you can schedule a time to have a chat. It’s impossible to speak to someone when you are feeling vulnerable. I have a telephone number where you can find a therapist near you. If you’re interested let me know.,Depressed

What kind of solution are you considering? Have you had trouble accessing mental health services? I’m a male and have never seen a discrepancy when it comes to sex.. but I’m interested in what you’re interpreting as an unfair system,Depressed
Why do you feel personally that you are struggling right now?,Depressed
"You’re having a really hard time with life right now. It must feel horrible. I agree, having someone you can reach out to when you need them can help so much. I read in another comment you were told to just get over it. That doesn’t work. If it did, we would all be fine. Sorry counseling hasn’t helped you. Not even hospitals. With early trauma, it can take awhile to heal and it never feels fast enough. I was emotionally abused growing up, and I was always told to not let it bother me. I tried, but I just hated myself that I couldn’t. I finally forgave myself for not just getting over it. It did affect me, and it hurt, and it can affect you after the event. It makes you see life as unsafe and maybe as if you weren’t meant for life.

As far as a friend, are you old enough to attend a depression support group? I made a friend in one because it was easier to talk to someone that understood me. Some meetings are online now and yiu can find them in different cities. I go to https://www.dbsalliance.org/

And did you give meetup.com a try. They are also online right now. Maybe you can join one that looks interesting. It’s easier to make a friend when you have something in common. Maybe read books on friendship and connecting with people. I did, and it helped me get some good friends. But yeah, grew up feeling very alone without someone to care about me and listen to me. 

But yes, it hurts so much being alone. And it is hard to live life with so much sadness. I like that you keep trying. I know that gets tiring. I hope you can find someone that understands your sadness and that understands you. Someone to talk about deep stuff and small talk. You so deserve that.",Depressed
"Being alone is a difficult thing, know at least you are not alone in that. It's obviously not a replacement for human contact but there are lots of online communities that are friendly hospitable places. If you have any hobbies or interests look up a youtuber for it or a sub reddit you can go too. Huge amounts of people right now are looking for a human connection, if you are able to be brave enough try finding like minded people and go all in.",Depressed
"If it's not related to something underlying and far more sinister like chronic anxiety or something, on the surface level I can recommend viewing your current situation as a stepping stone to something better in the future, being content where you are now to build skill and heart while you prepare yourself for the next level. Is the dream job still on the table in the future, and do you have good ideas on steps to close the gap between you and it someday?",Depressed
"is there opportunity to move away for job like that or similar? you kinda do have a freedom to do that, dont you?",Depressed
"You are afraid of moving away from your parent because you don't know if you can survive without them? We all had that feeling when we first move out. You just do it and overcome it. If you are not sure if this job is worth the move, then you need to tell us the salary, job growth potential, where is the new job located, you new expenses etc. That would be more of a personal finance question.",Depressed
" First of all, cutting of your prescription without proper withdrawal is not ideal to say the least. 

I don’t think your overreacting, but at the same time those emotions you feel won’t help you at all it will just make you feel worse. 

Some people tend to forget their friends when they get a partner, my friend for an example who I always used to workout and chill with now says 

“No il workout with (her name) tomorrow” not putting any effort into perhaps taking another date, or merely caring really. 

Have you already tried talking to them about it? I think it would be fair to just say you feel a bit excluded, of course as you said they are partners and they deserve their time alone.

But that doesn’t mean you should be left in the dust.",Depressed
"Depends on what the person means to you, personally I think it’s much better just stating that you aren’t interested but still be nice and grown up about it.",Depressed
"Don’t worry, you are not alone. With this isolation making my depression even worse, my care for hygiene dropped. I want to be clean and smell nice but when I think about getting up and taking a shower, it seems like the hardest thing in the world. It can be really fucking hard to push your yourself into doing it, but it always feel better afterwards.",Depressed
I can't even imagine how difficult that must be but I do know you're not a freak. The world is a shitty place sometimes and it's shits on the nice people first. If you are able to dis regard genger norms you have a incredible strength inside you. It might not feel like it but the longer you fight the easier it gets. Y,Depressed

Don't down play it if you think it may not seem as  ""grief worthy"" because they had no names. They were a constant in your life and evidently brought you peace to harmoniously live with these animals.

"Sorry for your loss

I felt bad when I accidentally killed a bowl of two or three goldfish that my mom had rescued from a wedding. It was unintentional and accidental though, like this was.

I was feeding them in my sister’s bathroom, and had the open food container on the sink. My arm brushed it, and almost all of the food fell into the sink, which I had recently used.

I didn’t want to waste the food by throwing it out or putting it down the drain, which was a mistake. What I did to avoid this was I scooped the food up and put as much back into the container as I could, then fed the fish from it.

The next day they were dead, because I guess soap residue stuck to the food. I’d recently washed my hands, use a lot of soap because of my OCD and hadn’t thought.

I felt bad",Depressed
"I'm sorry, friend. It's always hard to lose a pet, and I'm sure they meant a lot to you, but the situation was out of your hands, so you shouldn't beat yourself up over it.

"I’ve been keeping aquariums for years and this has happened to me twice, it straight up sucks. I know it’s not much help now, but if you decide to get some more fish, invest in a heater controller. I picked up one on amazon for like $29, it’ll turn your heater off in the event of a failure and keep the tank from overheating.

But now that I don't have him to cuddle with anymore, I have to cuddle a pillow and pretend it's him. It isn't the same, but I can tell he's still here in spirit. It's always terrible losing pets.

"I’m so sorry to hear this! I know how special bonds with other creatures (aside from humans) can be especially to someone suffering from depression. I to have depression but I have a cat and a dog ONLY because I have a long term SO I live with who cares for them primarily, because I usually can’t even care for myself. But one thing that I do on my own to feed that part of is that wants to care and love something special is plants! I have killed several plants by accident because I didn’t know what I was doing and I felt horrible about it but I decided to not give up and really do some research and get a handle on how to not mess up this time around. Idk what it is about these little leafy loves but I absolutely adore them and I stare at them, smell them, touch them, sing to them /talk to them (is a loving way when watering and pruning) and they bring my so much joy and make me feel like at very least I can keep a dang house plant alive I can’t be as bad at life as I think I am. Anyways plants for me are a really fun and helpful hobby when it comes to spending time on positive things. Maybe plants aren’t your thing maybe your thing is fish or maybe it’s something completely undiscovered yet, but if it brings you joy don’t give up on it even if you hit snags or mess something up. I’m sure your bubbly friends lived and appreciated you for the good life you gave them and the heater thing is totally unforeseeable and 100%. NOT your fault at all (even if it feels that way).

Sorry about your situation... praying for your loss buddy,Depressed
"OP, I'm really sorry for your loss.   Animals can be such a comfort, and because we interact with them every day, their absence can create a powerful sense of loss.

I would agree with the commenters who are suggesting new animals whenever you feel ready.  I was resistant to getting a new cat at first when I lost mine a couple of years ago, but I'm really glad I did.  And the reason is simply that when we lose an animal that has helped us cope, how are we supposed to cope with its death... without it?  I realized that I could only fill the hole in my heart with another cat.

You already have a tank, so maybe you could get some new types of fish, and use this as an opportunity to decorate it in a cool new way?  Or you could repurpose the tank and make your own ecosphere (i spent hours watching videos of these on YouTube).  It could be a chance to revitalize and deepen your passion and interest, not to say you don't have those, but there's always more to learn.  I'm impressed with anyone who's been able to sustain a fish tank for any amount of time, because it seems complicated and time-consuming!  And I have always wanted one...

Those fishies were lucky to be loved by you.

I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.

"Everything that is currently perceived as a problem can be viewed only as a temporary setback. You are destined for greatness. You already have made progress by recognizing areas needing improvement, and identified many attributes from the past and future.
 
I encourage you to find a 5 minute mindfulness practice on YouTube. There are longer ones and different keywords that you might experiment with and who know, you may grow to like it: “sitting mindfulness practice,” “walking mindfulness practice,” “20 minute mindfulness practice.” It’s a skeptical thing to try at first, but I believe with your phone notifications off, the extra time you have, located in an environment free from distraction, this practice could be helpful, and there are many benefits to it. It is truly the better medicine for many people. I started in college my freshman year a couple years back. It allows you to focus on sensations using your body and allows you to acknowledge any random thoughts as soon as you recognize you’ve drifted from that present moment. You can get right back on track by coming back to your breath and noticing that. 

Practice doing one thing in your day productive. It can be as simple as brushing your teeth, organizing a closet, pulling out old clothes you know you won’t wear and putting them in a donation box, or even buying a new pair of socks because they’re just great. Perhaps soon you could take more walks in various locations, secluded areas, or public parks; switch up between parks when things get redundant. Walk a different path than the traditional methods of others–because you have walked a different path and there’s no judgement there. There is a non-linear path to success for many of us who have struggled. 

Write down a checkbox of easy things you should accomplish, mixed with things you want to get done, and incorporate in larger tasks you might or might not get around to. A checkbox is motivating. Nothing is demanded or expected of you, but you can simply exist and that’s okay.  Know that in this very moment, your inhales and exhales are contributing to your life and the existence of other life forms around you and on this planet. You understand you’re important to someone, so you don’t want to hurt them by your secondhand suffering. Those past concerns should be of no worry; gone. There is nothing that we have besides this very moment, so look at anything in your room, notice it’s shape, imagine it’s texture, perhaps appreciate its quality, and be inquisitive on how it was constructed.",Depressed

"It does work. It wakes you up in every way by separating you from everything you know. I don't know you, but I do. I know exactly what you're going through because I rescued my best friend and watched her struggle through it and survive.

We're all locked down in India now but it'll open up soon. You can check out a little bit of her story on instagram at @gopormorawithjess (I was planning to employ her in one of my companies)...

I recently left an emotionally abusive relationship and two months later this happens. On the one hand i'm annoyed because i was trying to see friends again, and reconnect with people i drifted away from as a result of the abuse. But on the other hand the pressure to get my future sorted is a lot less, because the world is basically fucked right now. In all honestly this lock down reminds me of my abusive relationship, never being allowed to go out is exactly what i went through, and a part of my brain is kind of liking the fact that everyone is getting a taste of what i went through.

"I used to think like that as well...you’re never alone. The first step is loving yourself and taking charge of your life. That was my biggest issue, not having confidence or integrity for myself.

There’s nothing fucking wrong with being a lone wolf, but it’s an issue if you keep feeling sorry for yourself and blaming everything but YOURSELF for your circumstances. I highly recommend the book “The 7 habits of highly effective people” by Stephen R. Covey, It’s your choice to read it or not but what do you have to lose.

"I guess that your soul probably feels like you need more time to work on yourself. One lesson that I, **literally**, learned a couple of minutes ago was that you don't need a hero because that takes your independence away from you. It gives you an excuse to not be responsible, which you are. 

If you believe in that, we're experiencing a highly spiritual transformation during this time, so everyone is sensitive to the energy in the air. Which can be accelerated through self-improvement. 

Here are some things I started doing that I believe that will help you achieve this: 

• **SELF-KNOWLEGE -** Take half hour of your day to answer a self-discovery question. It'll allow you unlock your authentic self. If you go to Pinterest or Google Images, you'll find a sequence of pins called *""365 Days For A Better You""* that go from January to December, that'll be a great start. In a year from now, answer them again and compare your progress. 

• **STOP COMPARING -** One thing you should stop doing during this time is comparing yourself to others. It won't do you any good, and keep you from making spiritual progress. So, it's good to stay away from social media if that makes you see people who seem to have a greener grass and think *""Oh, how my life sucks! That should be me if this and that""*. It's time to learn to love yourself, remove this from your routine! 

• **BECOME INDEPENDENT -** You seek other people or run away from them because deep down you want a connection. But it won't be a healthy one if you think that you'll find your happiness in them. Instead of doing either of these things (seeking or running away), take a break and decide to work to become independent. Through studying and working, as well as through working on becoming the best version of you. 

• **CONNECT -** That doesn't mean you should stop connecting altogether, though. Even if you can't touch them because of the virus, spend more time with your family - and, those of you who have friends, with them too. If you stop thinking about yourself only, you'll heal the pains of others around you and promote a better environment for everyone. Like, for example, my aunt was stressed all the time the other day, so I got up and started helping her with home chores. Guess what? She was much happier before which reduced tension at home and avoided some arguments, lol. 

• **PLAN YOUR GOALS -** I know it's hard to do a lot of things with the covid-19 going around, but that's no excuse to plan a routine and goals. With them you have a focus and spend less time doing unproductive things. Laziness ***is*** an option. 

• **HAVE VALUES -** On your search to self-love, create playlists that will keep you motivated. Go to Amazon Unlimited and get those 30 days free - if you can't afford it now - to read some self-improvement books. Establish boundaries to create relationships you'll love in the future... Like for example *""the friendship code, or the girl code""*, which are rules you need to follow to be a good friend. Seek becoming more ethical. 

In resume, take the time you have left to work on these things and you'll feel much happier.",Depressed
"Maybe the quarantine does give me some peace, but I don't like a quarantine with lot of people suffering and dead.",Depressed
"I have the same feeling, but fail to accept it due to the burden of it being insensitive.

I’m just sad and depressed by this whole outcome, last week we made a pack to show our best version of ourselves for the remaining of our living situation and it hasn’t been going well ugh I just feel stuck and in such an awkward headspace.",Depressed
"I know that feeling. A part of me wants the lockdown to end tonight so everything is normal...

I obviously dont know your parents but my advice would be to be honest with them. Tell them you think you could really benefit from therapy and if they push back offer to discuss the issue with your normal Dr. Most primary care physicians are trained to at least recognize when therapy would be justified.,Depressed
I’m sorry you’re going through a hard time. I am too it’s not fun but we will get through this. I know it’s hard now but things will be okay.

And why would you need plans for when you are 30 years old? That’s twice your lifetime X2 away. 

Don’t dwell on your past, it will just consume you.

You say it yourself, you know what you are doing to yourself and I doubt that it’s actually “you” doing that.

Soo 

you want to do the work and you enjoy doing the work, but feel as though, if you're not on YouTube you are going to be in your own headspace thinking negative thoughts.
Could you listen to maybe a podcast, audio book, or music to keep your mind off yourself?

Unless your family is going to be harmful or abusive if you tell them, it might be a good idea to get their help and support, as tough as it may be to actually tell them.

Also, if you're ever in a crisis or having suicidal thoughts and/or self harm urges and don't want to bring it up to your parents, you can text the crisis text line if you're in the United States at **741741** and you'll be connected with a trained counselor who can help.",Depressed

If a girl came up to me and asked me out there’s a 90% chance I’d give it a go regardless of what she looked like. That’s probably because I’m also shy and have difficulty in approaching people-because in all honesty, I’m a bitch-but you get what I’m saying.

I am often drawn to extroverted friends and it isn't great but sometimes you learn things to appreciate about each other.",Depressed
"As a guy who has also never felt love from a girl i can say that there are boys whobfeel the same as you. You just don't meet them because they are also living in there own shells.

"Sending a little bit of love to you because I know what that feels like (albeit from a boy's perspective). It's hard to find love for certain people. Not because they are undesirable in any way, it's just that the process to find someone usually sucks and the sensitive people who may have some of the deepest love to offer are often bad at it. But from the few precious, fleeting moments of love that I've had (never a full, healthy relationship unfortunately) I've learned that it's too sweet a thing to give up on.

"I'm incredibly introverted which has made it tough to make friends, but I'm 28 now and have met people that are okay with only seeing me a handful of times a year.  

While it is hard to meet people as an introvert there are ways to ease yourself into it. The internet is incredible for stuff like that.  

Find forums, chatrooms, voicechats like hangouts or discords that relate to hobbies of yours, and try not to think too much about finding a boyfriend, rather just be yourself, and see who sticks.  
the people who'll get back at you are the ones you'll come to see as friends.  

In due time maybe you'll find the confidence to try it in real life, find a local group thats interested in things you're interested in and slowly build up.  

Rome wasn't built in a day, and we introverts just have to be a little more patient when it comes to building relationships and friends. That said, it will definitely happen, you're not alone. :)",Depressed

"The harsh truth is that the old cliche is true: you can’t rely on anyone with whom you have a romantic connection to make you happy. But notice I specified ‘romantic connection’.

I believe friends can and should be relied upon to make you feel better; we are social creatures and it is hardwired into our brains to want friends.

But romantic love in a depressed state is an awfully enticing trap. People tend to become reliant on it quickly and to a great extent. Relationships are not nearly as resilient as friendships most of the time; I’ve been friends with the same dudes since I was 5 and I’m 23 now. We’ve had fights, arguments and what have you, but we moved past them.

I hate this idea of ‘you have to love yourself before someone else can love you’ since loving yourself is in my opinion one of the hardest things to do as a human being, depressed or not. 

Instead I personally think it is better to heal your relationship with yourself first",Depressed

"Man I know exactly how you feel. I hit a point where this stuff started happening for me as well when I would think about my past.

You should definitely let the girl of your dreams read this post. It took me a long time to recognize what was happening. I'd have panic attacks and I was depressed, I was irritable and didnt know what was going on. I'd blocked out a lot of the things that happened to me but they began to return and began to think more about my past (sexual abuse, neglect, psychological and physical abuse, etc) like you. It makes sense that this related to the trauma you faced growing up and in your adult life. It can be triggered even later in life, the proverbial ""straw that broke the camel's back"" from stress.

One of the hardest things about depression is the feeling of worthlessness you're not alone in that. If you can try to find one thing you have a passion for or failing that even a passing interest and immerse yourself in it. Find a distraction and see if there is a community you can engage with. Talking online or leaving comments obviously isn't as ideal as I'm sure you'd hope but any human connection in my experience can help a great deal.,Depressed

I was coming off of drugs and incredibly depressed and a shower or even brushing my teeth was the last thing that I wanted to do. Who gave a shit anyway since all I did was mope and cry and feel sorry for myself. 
I guess when I was sick of feeling and looking utterly disgusting is when I started introducing hygiene back into my life. Then I started to realize that being clean made me feel better and brushing my teeth made me taste better lol so now a days I at the very least brush and floss my teeth. Just try your best, honestly there’s nothing else to do and once you’re in the shower you realize that it feels so nice and warm. You will feel more motivated for the day... maybe when you’re done showering you can throw on sneakers and go for a walk... baby steps..I’ll tell you one thing though, drugs and alcohol are setting you back..not helping at all... try to knock that off :P  Go shower! Enjoy",Depressed
"Hey man, I’ll try and help a bit if I can.

I suffer from depression, chronic pain, and am disabled which makes doing stuff like cleaning difficult (broke my back so have paralysis in legs and weak back muscles). 

Here’s what I do. 

1) Try to have a morning routine. get up - brush teeth - use toilet - shower. Keep it Simple. Don’t add anything extra.

This is the main thing for me. I’ve had this routine for years and feel weird if I don’t do it. It establishes a base line in my day, even if I don’t manage anything else I’ll achieve that.

2) if I can’t do a task. I’ll Try and get things set up for that task. For example, the washing up; I’ll get all the plates arranged neatly and clean around it a bit. Before tackling the washing up itself when I’m up to it.

3) doing stuff when I need to use the toilet. This may sound weird, but I’ve found I get a burst of impetus to get stuff done when I need to pee. Banking on this, if I get stuff set up to be dealt with (eg the washing up) then I’ll drink water and when I need to pee I’ll get some stuff done.

Hope this helps, looking back over it it’s not the best advice really but hopefully someone else can offer other tips!",Depressed
"This isn't something I've had a problem with but whenever I get really overwhelmed I put a timer on for 5 minutes and do something I like that doesn't really take much effort like watching dog videos or making faces or humming a random tune, etc. I know some of this sounds crazy but it just helps me loosen up a little and then I just take the easiest part of the task awaiting me. If it's a big task that I need to break up then it takes some time to get to it. But if it had already been broken up then it comes a lot easier. 

So let's try and break up hygiene for you - maybe just wash your hands and face and postpone the shower till you're ready. If it's taking out the trash then maybe put it in smaller bags so you need to put it out everyday or you could keep it on your counter in a vessel(like composters do with kitchen scraps) and just put it out every night. If you miss a night or two no biggie, don't beat yourself up, just try to do it the next day. I've found that with dishes although it's terribly annoying it's probably best to rinse them out as soon as you use them. It takes a while to get into the rhythm of it but with consistency it does get easier(but not less annoying). Also maybe attempt one thing at a time and do it regularly for a few days before adding the next thing. 

I sound like I've got this all down pat but no. I'm also trying to see what works. I've been a lot less fuzzy for a few days so I'm trying to make the best of it.

"I have used all three and will list my experiences (as you know evryone reacts highly differently)

I was (and still are, but less) severely depressed with a lot of anxiety.

I will use month 0 as the first month of taking meds.

Month 0: seetraline 10 mg. Didn’t do much for me. Almost felt no difference taking it. Could be because of the alcohol I drank alongside. No feelings of emotional blunting, basically no effects at all.

Month 1.5: sertraline 10mg —> 25 mg. Still did nothing (same as before). No difference between 10 or 25 mg.

Month 2.5/3: sertraline 25mg—> sertraline 100mg: only negative effects. No motivation, no fun, no pleasure, no sex drive, no improvement whatsoever. Felt like a living zombie and out of touch with reality.

Month 4: switched sertraline to Wellbutrin. First 150 MG then:

Month 5: 300 mg Wellbutrin. A lot of difference. Sexually really active and aroused, a lot more energy and desire to get up in the morning. (Sometimes a little too much energy in the night which kept me from sleeping) this felt really good. 

Month 6/7: added citalopram first 10 mg then 20 mg. The Wellbutrin gave me a lot of energy and “spice” haha but i was still really anxious so the extra energy would be wasted on being anxious or not living the extra energy to the fullest if that makes sense.

Now: Wellbutrin XR300 mg, citalopram 20mg. A really good combination for me.

"I spent many years addicted to heroin. The state of my arms still offers a reminder to me each day.

It offered a perfect way to switch depression off just like a light switch for me. Simple solution.

But it also stripped everything from me that I held dear and I ended up sleeping rough on the streets for about 4 years.

I was beaten up and urinated on in my sleeping bag trying to just get some sleep for a few hours on the streets of East London.

I was shoplifting prolifically to afford it and was arrested many times making it very hard to ever get a job again.

It was a brutal existence.

It’s a short term solution, a quick fix. But the problems only ever get worse. And all my original problems were still there after the drugs stopped working.

And then there is the withdrawal - brutal physical pain and the worst pit of depression I ever felt trying to come off it. Taken me many years to feel anywhere near normal again.

Life can be hard but I assure you that getting into the grip of drugs will make it considerably worse for you. You might enjoy a few weeks or months of psychological benefit from it, I won’t lie. But it comes at a vast, vast cost. Much of my life will always be ruined as a result. Loved ones I hurt so badly will never speak to me again.

As far as depression is concerned opiates are your friend, your lover, your safety, your inspiration, your _heroine_. Liquor will make your problems worse so it’s good you stay away.

"The best years of your life are the ones which you make the best and are only defined by what you make of it. OP, there is literally nothing to be ashamed about in achieving a degree in literature, you should be proud that you have come so far and accomplished this. The importance of a degree is dependent on what you make of it, sometimes the right job just has to present itself for the scenario and that may take a while, but it will come so long as you do not give up. You have an astronomical amount of fulfilling experiences and potential ahead of you at 25, and it is never to late to chase after your dreams and aspirations.

Don’t ever say that you wasted your time, you have to remember that those things brought you many enjoyable moments and were important to you before. These pastimes infinitely enhance a healthy balanced lifestyle, and will never be a waste of time or life when you are truly at peace. Every experience is an important milestone to becoming who you are today, and the better person you will be down the line. Make peace with yourself, and know that finding love and affection elsewhere is not a good choice when you do not love yourself.

My lifetime of failures just seemed like the mistakes people make as part of life. The deficiencies in my present just seemed like things I needed to do, that I could do. In short, everything was different and life was worth living. It's left me with a grim determination to get that back. I used to have a list of treatments that I was going to try and if they all failed, I was going to kill myself. But I've taken suicide off the list because I know I could get it back. I just share this as an alternative to wishing not to exist. There are powerful therapies out there like TMS, Spravato, ECT that you may never even get told about.

If you are suicidal, you are definitely depressed (in my opinion). I would ask you to make an appointment with a psychiatrist as soon as possible to talk to them honestly about everything that is going on inside you and your feelings. You very well may need medication. They will decide with you.

If you are in immediate danger of hurting yourself please call 1-800-273-8255 or text HOME to 741741 right now.

You are much stronger than you think right now. You are important and have value and are needed.

Go see a doctor. Maybe a therapist too. They can start to set you on the right track. Be honest with whomever your true self is inside is at all times. Give time to others. Giving, volunteering, mentoring has helped millions discover who and why they are here.

I wish you peace, health, and love

I believe these behaviours are learned - whatever these people have experienced/seen in life, it’s taught them that putting others down and self-preservation is the way to fit in and survive in this world.

"Hey, OP. I resonated with a lot of what you wrote here and I just want to say, goddamn, you are being incredibly hard on yourself. You have had quite a bit going on. It's hard when you look back on your life and see the many mistakes you've made and how you should have done x, y, and z but what's usually missing from those self-deprecating thoughts is context. 

I want to say that mental illness doesn't discriminate. You could have the healthiest upbringing and be very wealthy and still deal with bipolar disorder, adhd, depression, and anxiety. Nature plays a big role in what we carry in life. Our genetics, our general temperament, what triggers us, a lot of that is a consequence of the genetic lottery. You didn't choose any of that. 

Listen, I know the feeling of being smart and feeling like you wasted all of your potential. But one, you still have plenty potential and two, you're dealing with a heck of a lot. You witnessed the decline and eventual death of a parent. That is incredibly traumatic and a big ordeal that effects your life and ability to do things. Major breakups and loss of love can really destroy people, it's one of the leading triggers for depression. Bipolar Disorder (which I have) can be one of the worst, most debilitating illnesses anyone can deal with. You're dealing with all of that, chronic pain and fatigue, and a whole host of things that I haven't mentioned. None of what you have to deal with is easy. None of it is something you willed. 

You're saying you should have pushed and applied yourself more. It's like asking yourself to continue hiking up a mountain carrying a heavy backpack that just gets heavier as you go, eventually collapsing under the weight, and being like I should have been able to make it to the top. In your current situation, you have financial support but a virtually nonexistent support system outside of that. People need support and others to continue carrying on.

Honestly, OP, there are plenty of points in your post where you address direct reasons for not functioning the way you'd like and yet you view the consequences of all of your mental and physical illnesses as a personal failing. It's not. You're understandably overwhelmed and exhausted. Anyone would be.

"So I think the thing is for people like us, we came to completely go through our journey of growth and meanwhile in depression. You know, all the moods, mindsets, confusion, to then learn and understand it, that's literally to be seen in depression, there's a certain capacity to what this illness has to offer. When you have clinical depression, the opposite is not happiness, but vitality. We could quite literally never reach a state of full clarity and bliss, but the paradox is that state of mind for us is found in getting on a set schedule for our bodies, making sure you're getting appropriate sleep, eating, putting yourself outside enough, etc. (Which I know you know already), coming to a good baseline on your personal thinking (good attitude) and the last piece you're missing is the one you're looking for. This is why, most artists of anything have depression, and alot of people who are depressed go on to make art, music, movies etc. It proves the powerful self thinking, you are it. You are it's creation and the creation. Doesn't even have to be art. Anything that expresses the dread you're facing every Day, that's what makes it have it's purpose for every second you live and continue to go. You've learned it all. You've fought it all. You continue to now battle at the highest point you could reach. But it's not worth shit to us if we're going to continue to fight it and not make it INTO something. Society is designed for the modern idiot. We will never feel fulfilled in it because it's nothing new, and we know this. And we're here to create more than that. Find what you're here to create in expressing what you face. You're putting up the best fight you ever have with your depression, and expressing that is what makes getting through the tough moments and being the powerhouses we are actually matter. Matter in our OWN heads. The only one that does matter. And if you atleast tried, you did your best and I'm proud of you for that.",Depressed

I've struggled with my weight and depression for years and what my counsellor says is true - you cant hate yourself into being skinny, you have to love yourself into being healthy.  You need to focus on what's right for you, some people are naturally thicker set while others are slender despite trying to gain weight constantly. You need to listen to your body and feed it as if it were something you were looking after, you wouldnt deprive it of meals but you wouldnt give it a stupid amount of food either. 

My depression was never caused by my weight but when I was about your age I started realising how different my body was from the 'ideal' and hating my body for being that way. Nowadays even the 'ideal' bodies dont look like how we see them in media, even without photoshop we never see their bad angles or unposed which is how we see ourselves all the time.",Depressed

"I don't mean to put you down but this Reddit post makes it seem like you are misunderstanding the society around you. It also is written in such a way that I feel that you have this sense of 'entitlement' to a relationship, almost like it's a basic human right that you should have, but you don't and that's why you're mad. 

As a non-virgin female, we really don't care what experience the other guy has, any sexual experience feels good if it's with someone you love. I just feel like you're taking the wrong steps to feeling happy. I have had your exact same desires at one point in my life as well, and the relationship that I got in order to 'complete' myself was actually detrimental to my long-term mental health. This is because I relied too much on the relationship and threw away my independence. From what you have typed here, it seems to me that you may be prone to being too reliant on a future relationship.

Some girl will find you one day and you're still quite young. However, a good relationship usually comes only when you aren't actively seeking a relationship. It's like don't look out for ANY girl to have a relationship with, it's more like: go out and live your own life, don't care about anyone else's opinions, try to love yourself, and if a certain girl's personality or spirit really attracts you, then go for it and talk to her. 

Just be careful of having too many hopes on a relationship. It's not as good as it seems, it's a LOT of effort but it CAN be very rewarding!",Depressed
It's hard to loves yourself at times but the more things you achieve the more confident you'll become.

"I haven't taken/needed medication for about four years now, so my memory of it all is pretty hazy. But I was on both for about a year each - not at the same time. I've also been on Abilify, Zoloft, and Lithium. 

Honestly, medication didn't really do anything for me, that's why I tried so many different kinds. Whenever my friends or family would ask me if my medication was working, I would always answer ""I don't know."" I was still miserable, filled with negative thoughts, and engaging in self-destructive behaviors. Any benefits of the medication was dwarfed by my depressive symptoms. I didn't suffer from any side effects other than upset stomach and nausea, but I would often take my meds without eating so that was probably the cause of that. 

I do have genetic tendencies towards depression, but my actual disorder at the time was pretty much all environmental. So I only got better through therapy and life-style changes. It was about eight years from the time I was diagnosed to where I felt normal again. 

I'd say try the new medication if you can afford it. You can always stop taking it if you don't like it or it doesn't work. If your mood is noticeably worse without medication, then that's a sign it's working - antidepressant withdrawal is definitely a thing. But medication tends to be a short term solution, it'll help alleviate symptoms of depression, but it won't address the issues that caused it in the first place.  

I'm not a medical professional though, so this is all my educated opinion. Keep doing your research and experimenting with solutions, you got this.",Depressed

I hope you can distance yourself until you can share with him calmly your hurt and pain too from losing your mom and his behavior and abuse in the past and especially now. And if that cannot happen you may have to just distance yourself as much as possible just to avoid the toxicity. Just understand when he explodes, tells, etc... it's not personally about you. He's in pain. He's messed up inside.  I don't say that to excuse his behavior. I say that so you can let go of its power on you.

Once you truly understand all his bullshit isnt about you you'll be free forever even when he is around and even if he is acting out. Because it ain't about you brother. Hes fucked up. Sorry. Hes got to work that shit out for himself and maybe MAYBE one day he will. And if he does you'll know it because for one his behaviors will get better but two he will acknowledge he hurt you in the past and apologize and try to make amends. That's up to him. Not to say you shouldn't share your emotions and feelings too. But if hes not ready and you only get screamed at for doing so... you got to let his shit lay where it resides. IN HIS COURT.

After you let him own his shit if he does it or not you can be free to become or be your true self. Stay away from him if that is needed.

"It helped me a lot when it let go of all the shit I couldn't control my dad said to me that was cruel and abusive. I finally came to accept he was doing the best he could.

That's not that he could have done better. But maybe he wasn't brought up, or was too stressed out, or depressed or whatever. 

When I took his power over me away and just said ""he was doing the best he could."" It opened a door for me to be able to forgive him even though hes never acknowledged my pain hes inflected on to me. And it made him human. Just like me. Not some all knowing authority figure... or at least ""the one that knows what's best for me."" All that went away when I realized he was doing the best he could, because he was human, messed up at least as much as me.  

It was freedom to get him carry his own shit he so desperately tried to get me me to inherit.

At the very least, it seems clear that you feel sorry for your actions and though he is really upset with you and feels hurt, all you can do is apologise sincerely and express how much you regret your actions and let him deal with his emotions alone. With time and allowing an open dialogue about what happened, he may give you another chance because I'm sure he loves you very much as well.

"A nice wording I have heard is that you don't have any mental space at the moment. If you told her that you are struggling yourself and are just managing to cope I am sure she would understand. Furthermore, if her coping mechanism is reassurance it seems she may be anxious which means that you just giving her verbal assurance will go a long way. I would guess the listening to her issues or having her be 'annoying' may be a big source of your emotional drainage. If you both find ways to give to each other energy without giving your own I think that would be the best, these are just sentences you can repeat to her to let her know your there or spending some time with her and then some time away etc.  


Take care of yourself first, but if there are ways you can help her without giving her your mental energy you should if you can :)

"Must have felt good - crying that is. You don't realize how much something means to you until you loose it. Until you gain it again. Whatever was on that letter, that's what's wrong with your life. It's not going to change, you saw it yourself, it still holds true. Nothings going to change unless you change it. And I don't mean to be cliche or patronising but you have to act, things don't change by then selves. Your acting by killing yourself, but your not changing your life, your just making it not your life, your getting rid of your life. That changes nothing. That sadness will be the last thing you feel, and at best, if your lucky, you'll cry.

That's no way to die.

But you see you can change, you can fight against what your mind is telling you. Not because that's what I want to believe, but because your doing the most unnatural thing possible, everything in your body, in your mind is going ""don't die"", don't kill yourself.

My mom always told me, there are enough people in this world willing to beat you up, you can't be one of them and beat yourself up. You used a lot a phrases like a part of me believes. That seems like trying to have it both ways. You know you have a disease but you're also allowing yourself to give in to the disease when it lies and says it's just a character flaw. You have to aggressively go after that idea and eradicate it. Give it no space in your thoughts. You have a disease. You are deserving of the same compassion and understanding that anyone with an illness is. And anyone who doesn't get that is just ignorant. And you better be ready because I don't believe that the well can ever understand the mentally ill, no matter how much they may want to our try to.

"it's not your fault. it's your brain not giving you the right signals to reward you for things that are good and feel good. your brain just needs the right push to produce enough (and not too much) of the chemicals it's supposed to. 

you've probably heard that before but maybe I can help with my own story. I take medicine and have been for the last 4 years and it just makes these pits of despair and (for me) panic attacks easier to deal with. the feelings aren't as strong and I can face them easier. that doesn't mean it's easy, but the medicine sure does help. combined with surrounding yourself with supportive people and counseling, life is a bit better for me than it was before. 

it took me years to get here but I'm glad I didn't end anything when I was 16 and started to feel the worst for the first time (I'm 21 now). I lost a friend to suicide less than a year ago and I just can't believe everything she's missed since then, good and bad. I wish I could've stopped her and I wish I could stop everyone feeling like this from hurting themselves, but I know I can't. all I can do is offer my metaphorical hand to hold during the bad times. I know it can be infuriating to hear and impossible to believe, but this won't last forever and things will get better. Depression is NOT the ""voice of reason"" it claims to be and just because it's confident doesn't mean it's right about anything. that helps me get through depression sometimes so I hope it helps you a bit.

There's not many who have hurt like you do, loost people like you have.

And your left always trying to catch your breath, always reaching for one deep breath but your chest won't expand. Who can face that? You where 15 then 18, 19, 20 now? No one thinks, no one expects a 15 year-old a 20 year-old to cope with that. Life hurts, and death makes our mistakes final. You where human, you where angry, but know what you did was not out of spite, not to hurt. Your mother, the way you describe her, she sounds the forgiving type, or that she'd forgive you. And how she cared for you, she would never say you didn't deserve to live, and she could never see to watch you die. Your father too - no parent could bear see their child die before them. 

Try to do better. In a world where we're powerless, in a world so permanent, there is so little we can do but try. The past is the past, and all that was the past has past.

The most important things that helps me is making small lists. I make one for things I need to do for the week. Then each day I pick things from that list, maybe 4/5 and cross them off. Physically seeing myself make progress and being able to track it is a reward for me, it helps me feel like I’m at least doing something with my life. Some times I really slice things up and use stickers too. When I finish my list I feel a weight lift. While I may not be doing ok emotionally, I can at least track my progress and know thats there’s something good I’m able to do, get done, or accomplish. 

Edit: Some other useful tips about class scheduling because fall semester is coming. 1.) Schedule your classes later than 11am. Be realistic, there’s no way you’re making it to a 9:15 on time. Even if your alarm goes off the urge to sleep in will overpower you. So set yourself up for success and schedule later. 

2.) Don’t take an online class if you can be there in person. Physically moving can do a lot to improve your mood. Wether you’re walking or driving it helps you clear your head. Plus when there’s good weather that will also help boost your mood. Taking classes in person will also help you feel like you’re doing things and getting stuff done. 

Bonus: Most classes care a lot about attendance and you can get a good grade by just showing up!! Motivation is hard, but if you’re realistic and plan your classes/life around your depressive habits you can still function (:",Depressed

"It's fucking rough. But I would say the structure helped me significantly to complete it. My social life was very minimal but I did great at school and just graduated in this shitshow of a world right now.

"I’m in my last year of college and the fact that I’ve made it this far still surprises me sometimes. It definitely wasn’t a pleasant experience. Most of my more vivid memories are me stressing over deadlines or before an exam, beating myself for not trying harder.

For me it was one of the few things that actually helped my depression. Kept my mind occupied. I really enjoyed it and found it really fulfilling. Plus the good grades I was getting really helped my self esteem and self worth. If I could I would just be a full time student indefinitely because going to school is when I’m the happiest. But I’ve always had a real thrive to learn. It’s just something I genuinely enjoy. Plus it felt like a break from work and life and everything else. It was the one thing I did that was 100% for me. It was almost a form of self care in that way. I didn’t post this to make you feel bad just know not everyone is the same. We just all have different interest and coping skills.,Depressed
"When I wasn't coping well with my depression, I ended up getting a 66.6% GPA at a top tier university. I truly felt like I had wasted a spot at my university and someone else should have made it in other than me, because clearly I was a waste of space in the program AHAHA. I couldn't bring myself to leave the house or even my bed. I never even did homework assignments for weeks on end because I didn't care about life or anything.

When I started taking antidepressants, it started to make me feel more normal. I could never have predicted how different it was going to make my life just because it made me able to leave my bed and so on. I ended up bouncing back like reeeeally slightly the semester after took antidepressants but my GPA has been very much hurt AHAHA... 

From experience, I can understand how people can complete courses for sure like back in that semester I got mostly 55s to 70s at most, but I don't understand how people with depression can get a high GPA AND do a lot of extracurriculars for job experience and so on. ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. I could never LOL but I'm gonna have to try, since it's my university's standard....",Depressed
"I don't have the answer. Where I am from, there isn't much structure in uni. Most of them do not require attendance, you don't have to write essays and you don't fail courses, you have 3 years and that's it. And sincerely, this is my third year and I didn't do much. I am really struggling, but the best thing is to go to therapy and do something every day, even if it's reading 2 pages. Don't do it with deadlines (I mean, idk if you have one but even if you do, just finish it really early). Do not take many classes/courses and please try to make it enjoyable and an opportunity to grow, and not a rush to the end. Wishing you luck.",Depressed

Don't let anything take school away from you.",Depressed
"Honestly i completely failed last year and i’m paying the price for it now but I think university, gives me a sense of purpose. Especially after changing my major to what I want it to be rather than what I thought would make me “employable” it just gives me something to do rather than think about how shit life is i can just focus but then maybe it’s just a way for me to avoid thinking too much. There are still a lot of days where I don’t do anything but at least there is something for me to do.",Depressed
"I completed college but depression made its mark.. I was doing really badly mentally one year and this caused my grades to plummet (for that semester only).

"Yeah it's difficult, and slow. I just kind of grind through it as best I can. Initially I tried taking a full course load but it was overwhelming and not good for mental health. I reduced it and it helped. Later on with work I did other degrees as a part-time student.
  
It's okay to take a reduced course load. Go as slowly as you need to. Some people can handle a lot of stress without burning out but not everyone has that superpower. Just pick one thing and work away at it, slowly but surely, and you'll eventually finish your degree.",Depressed

"I took an extra year to complete my degree. 

It found it really hard. Ngl. I’d be sitting on the laptop to do research and my mind would just wonder everywhere or I’d feel overwhelmed and just go to bed. I went months at a time without attending any lectures and just kept an eye on assessment dates etc. Somehow managed to pass every exam I sat and every coursework I handed in. But always felt shit because it wasn’t my best work and I could have done better if I’d actually been at lectures/tutorials, instead of learning it straight from the textbook.

When I did turn up, hardly anyone knew me and I had no friends. 

I hated it. It was a shitty experience because I was too depressed to engage properly.

I keep having dreams that I’m young again and I’m back at uni and I do it all properly this time. I always feel really sad afterwards. I guess it was a deep regret of mine. Like a chunk of my youth I missed out on.

Everyone has these great memories, great friends, great stories. A whole bunch of my friends from school married the guys they dated at uni and I just remember being at home and struggling to study on my own, then walking out of the exam hall alone, while everyone discussed the exam with their friends all excitedly and went for coffees etc.",Depressed

It was embarrassing at first but it helped a lot to get registered with Student Disabilities with documentation of my condition, and giving notice to my professors that I’m currently dealing with health problems and may require occasionally leniency with due dates and things like that.

"My crippling anxiety and perfectionism were largely what kept me afloat. I was taught from a VERY young age that school is extremely important and was told early on that my parents wouldn’t pay for my schooling, so I’d need to get scholarships. I did end up with a full scholarship, but I also grew up connecting my value as a person to how good my grades were. 

It didn’t always work—I absolutely did not maintain a perfect GPA—but was enough to get a job in my field and go to grad school. Allowing myself to not be “perfect” was necessary in maintaining my sanity. 

OP, don’t beat yourself up. The pandemic has made everything infinitely harder, especially with regard to mental health. Our semester just ended, and the lack of structure caused me to give less effort to my classes. Shit’s hard right now. You’re not alone.",Depressed

I'll just be grateful to pass.",Depressed
"I had extreme anxiety and depression in college and I just graduated last month somehow. Every day was just a complete battle to get through. There were some classes where I made some friends and felt okay in. Presentations were the absolute worst. I think I did about 4 in total but I would always almost have panic attacks. I managed to get good marks in the second half because I was tired of doing so poor in every aspect in my life and just wanted to improve.

A lot of messed up things happened in my life at the end of high school which threw me into emotional rock bottom and I stayed there for many years. I can understand how some people could enjoy college if they're emotionally and mentally strong. For me though, it was hell 95% of the time. I'd recommend anyone who had mental health issues to sort them out before college.

"Because there's an end in sight, it's convenient to soldier through it by keeping that goal in mind. At the same time, it's also easier to not think so far ahead, for the example about what to do after you graduate, because that's very distracting, and instead just take the days/weeks/months as they come, being as efficient as you need to to lessen your own burden. In that case, you can also see working hard as some kindness you can do to yourself, because the world sure ain't going to stop over your plight. That's the key I think, treating the grind as being kind to yourself, I mean you're the one trying to get through higher education, and presumably, you want to see it to the end and don't want the effort spent to go to waste, so what else can you do but do your work for you?",Depressed
Currently going through an episode with the exact same issue. I actually think it's caused it. I basically just spend hours thinking about doing it followed by like 20 minutes of intense work at a time.

"I think it's a cliché ""it depends"" situation. For me, I've always tried to find ways to escape my family home. As a child, I never understood why elementary and high school were so difficult for me. Coming home straight after school killed my motivation, and being home schooled for high school almost got me held back my junior and senior years.

It all made sense by the first week of college. Jumping in my own car, deciding my own work load, and staying on campus as long as I needed/desired. I get through the stress of juggling mental illness and school work because college is my freedom. And I know, if I take my time and stay dedicated, my degree will be my independence.

Things are different now with social distancing. My school will be online-only for the rest of 2020. So I'm taking summer off and I'll see how I feel when fall comes around. Maybe now is my chance to do that Big Sur road trip I've been delaying!

"As someone who has been depressed for nearly 6 years and going into their final year of an undergraduate degree this September: I have no idea.

I took a year out before uni to work and get money behind me, and it solidified that I definitely want a degree so i can not work a low paid, high hour role. Since then, I have struggled at every deadline. I’m smart, dedicated and hard working - pre depression. Now a days, I ignore deadlines to make my mental health better in the now, but when it’s time to actually start it I just force myself. My mental health is then AWFUL and i get so overwhelmed I want to kill myself (every time without fail), it’s like dropping out isn’t an option - i just want to die. I have postponed a few deadlines when I’m in a really bad place or I know I can’t do it right now, and that’s okay (although I beat myself up for it even more).

Since day one of first year, I’ve thought about leaving, and I do everyday. But what keeps me going is: 1. I would hate myself if I drop out and never forgive myself for the missed opportunity, 2. I know I don’t want to work at a supermarket for the rest of my life (where I work currently), 3. I have no idea what direction to take my life I leave.

I do the work and I continue to degree because it’s the only thing in my life that gives my purpose and worth. I hate it, but there’s nothing else going for me. But it sucks slowly losing passion and drive for the one subject you love. Plus I’m over half way through now and I’m not ready for all that debt to go to waste. If I knew what i know now before i started this degree, i wouldn’t have enrolled. I know that I can do it, but it will be the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do in my life.",Depressed
I have one year of university left and have been trying to live with depression since the first year. Personally there's no magic answer it's just a battle day by day.

I did it but I basically broke down following graduation,Depressed
"It’s the sense of accomplishment I guess. I’m in college as a 4.0 student and it’s the sense of “well, if I can’t do anything else right I might as well throw myself into this.” It also gives a sort of structure. With classes being online, it’s like anchoring your day so you feel like you did at least one thing throughout the day. Might be different for others though",Depressed
"You have to force yourself to do it. University gave me structure in my life, yes, but at the same time it isn't because I have higher degree of independency. Yes the lecturers gave me shit tons of things to do, but at the same time they wouldn't care much if you didn't turn those paper on time (or ever, at all) because they regard you as adult and you usually don't tell another adults what to do unless they're sick/harm to themselves and/or others. 

Add the fact that I lived alone in a new city and didn't really mingle with people, sometimes the loneliness would be way too crushing that it left me paralysed on my bed, crying all day. Plus university courses and workloads were heavy, the profs didn't hesitate to give us tons of works with tight deadline. Its not rare for me to turn in half-assed works because I didn't have the energy and motivation to do it. I knew I could do better, which only made me even more bitter and frustrated. 

The feelings of loneliness, helplessness, and frustration were really at its peak during thesis writing. Usually people finish their thesis in 1 semester span, but mine took 3 semesters because I was too depressed. I even checked myself to the mental clinic at the hospital so I could get the help I needed. Therapy helps immensely too. There's always hope, but hope is just a fleeting thing as long as you don't force yourself to turn that hope into reality. 

Hopefully you are getting the help you need.",Depressed

The apathy is the worst part about depression. Nothing matters anymore. Even music the one thing that I really love and should’ve gone to fucking school for is barely keeping me sane these days. Some days I can’t even bring myself to make music or practise anymore. 

I really should go get clinically checked but my living and familial situation is such a fuck up that I can’t just ‘go’. I’m isolated, angry and apathetic, I never **ever**thought I’d be where I am today when I was in high school. So much for being gifted and talented. What a load of bullshit.

"I really wanted to pursue a bachelor's in computer science, but depression held me back from trying as hard as I can to get the minimum GPA to be accepted into the College of Engineering at my university. I was forced to switch to Media and Information, a topic I really don't care about, but is *slightly* related to CS and an easy major. I'm only still in college because I think some kind of degree would be better than no degree at all when it comes to full-time job opportunities. After one more class I'll be graduating in June, but not with a degree I care about, therefore I really don't give a shit about graduating because I'm still trying to pursue a CS career. My MI degree will only exist to prove I attended and graduated college.

Depression has also held me back from getting any significant internships during summer vacations, so I wasn't able to get any guidance or support for learning new things in the CS world on top of not being able to take important CS courses at my university. I have to learn everything by myself, which while it may be rewarding to say you're completely self-taught, is extremely taxing and feels like I have no time for anything else in my life because I have so much catching up to do on top of trying to find a job after I graduate. I've been rejected by pretty much every single place I applied to and have been trying so hard to learn what I need to learn to land a job. Seeing literally everyone else in my life achieve what they set out to do, or on the path to achieving their goals, has been *extremely* discouraging too and doesn't do anything for me in terms of motivation.

Honestly, attending college has done nothing but make my depression worse with every passing year. I feel like I've progressively lost friends, been slowly losing my social skills, forgotten how to ""play the game"" to find a S/O, and am very far from achieving any career goals. I was so happy and confident in myself back in high school, but I can't even imagine what it would feel like to be happy and confident again. After dealing with increasing hopelessness and sadness, it feels like that's the only thing I'll ever feel anymore. I still have moments where I'm happy about something, but it just feels wrong and I always end up depressed again. It's a horrible cycle and I'm so fucking sick of it.

What I'm trying to say is, you're not alone. I have felt and still feel the same way about college as you do and don't understand how these people power through their depression and not give in.

Okay. It rests in that, just as anxiety can have different levels, so too can depression. Mild depression, moderate depression, chronic (long term over years) depression & major (dehabilitating <paralyzing> depression. 
Personally, mine eases off on rare occasions, has been chronic since the age of 6 (after initial shock from the sexual assault I had no one ""safe"" to tell wore off) & gets really bad (active suicide attempt).at times. 
Generally, even severely depressed persons don't want to die, they're looking for a 'permanent' relief from their suffering &/or get away from the cause of their suffering. 
For myself, I viewed the path of education as a means to physically remove myself from my antagonists & abusers - moving out of state to go to college. I didn't ""excel"" at it,  but struggled to keep up & get all the work done to keep going (graduated in the lowest allowed GPA range). I chose at young age to choose & act rationally regardless of how bad I felt. My emotions would have kept me paralyzed. Yes, ""feels"" ARE valid - they're neither ""good"" or ""bad"" - it's what you do (or don't do) with them. But they aren't cold hard reality. When you have the place or someone truly safe to express them, feel your feels. But to survive, you 1st have to choose to do what's needed to exist/survive. Then keeping on keeping on doing studies, graduating & even working day to day thereafter (or whatever it is needful in the moment for you) - regardless of how onerous getting out of bed & just ""doing"" is each da. For me, this was an act of self validation my family of origin couldn't & wouldn't provide. *I* have to choose each day to commit to the simple belief ""I can do this & get through this"". After all, If I won't even act like I believe in myself, how can I lament, gripe & justifiably complain that ""no one"" else will stick up for me?",Depressed

I thought college would get my lazy ass to actually work and have a structure but I never wanted to do anything. I wasted most of my time and was just too depressed to care. Part of me regrets it but another part of me feels like how acted was justified. I wanna be motivated to do things and be successful but I'm also not gonna downplay my feelings and reactions to them. Long story short I ended up leaving before getting a degree but I decided to keep moving forward and I found a job. Doesn't pay much but I don't regret it.

I think tho, if my program was any longer and I didn't have the ability to go home, I would have dropped out 100%. 

I honestly think the trick is having a support unit.",Depressed
"I created a Google doc and turned it into a planner where I would plan out the entire semester for all classes (color-coded) in one calendar. I used the syllabus to write due dates (always a week before the actual due date) then I linked in assignments or reading or links to folders in my drive where the work could be found. I also broke up big assignments into smaller more manageable ones like ""intro"" ""conclusion"" ""outline"" etc.

Then each day, I log on and click the work I need to do for the day. I don't need to even think about the other work, I just have one relatively short assignment to knock out and turn in or out in the final project. 

I found that doing this eliminated a lot of the stress of feeling overwhelmed by the amount of work and not knowing where to start so not starting anything. Plus, I worked ahead and ended up turning things in early which sometimes leads to professors providing feedback before the due date so I could fix and resubmit (or just take the grade and call it a day). Also, if something came up I could push something back a day and not worry OR if I was feeling extra motivated one day I could work ahead and give myself some breathing room. 

I've also always done on line classes since my Associates and I'm in my last semester of graduate school.

"For me it was a distraction. Though I don't like the term, my psychiatrist at the time said it was high-functioning depression versus the kind that keeps one in bed.

Don't read this next part if you aren't looking for advice:

My strategy was to write the intro and conclusion first, they are the fluffiest, easiest part of the paper. Once I had those, I was 25-33 percent done, *and* I knew what points I wanted to make, and where I wanted to end up.

Nextly, I would pick out what quotes I want to use. It's a pain in the butt to stop your writing flow and look for quotes midparagraph, so beforehand I'd get least 8-10 good quotes (for a 5 page paper). Now I was 50-75 percent done.

Writing sucked, but the hardest part was the transition sentences. I saved those for last.

I did the same for all subjects for all the exams.. I got 75% aggregate.. I simply didn't care.. On the off hand, if I'd care, I would overdo it and probably score around the same.. I'd beat myself up for all the dumb things I did wrong and feel like shit.. Hope is a dangerous thing.. I have none.. My advice here, atleast what I do is that I prepare for the worst.. I believe am going to do bad, but prepare for the task anyway and when am doing the task, I think about things that I'll do to cheer myself up for doing so bad.. Something dumb like getting that favourite ramen noodle flavor or that game that I like playing or whatever else it is.. This is kinda like watching a horror movie that you've seen before.. You know all the bad parts and you brace for it.. I know it's exams for you.. So what worked for me might not work for you.. But still, just thought I'd write something for the sake of it..

I have been struggling with depression for over 5 years and it’s been really bad the past 8 months.

Though intellect does help, I feel a depressed person will always have to put in more work to compensate for the effects of their depression. 

I slept very little during university (2 - 4h mostly) and this was a vicious cycle because I would end up feeling sleepy and spend even more time than I normally would on work. My 'normal' well-rested level of productivity was already low because I get distracted or overwhelmed easily and once I start crying that would be the end of the day's productivity. 

Depression made me a workaholic (an unproductive one) but not because of any positive motivations. Good results felt like the only thing I had left to my name, and this was detrimental because I catastrophised every assignment and exam. Hard work is also a form of self-harm. My life and health are so worthless to me that I was cool with damaging my brain/body with chronic sleep deprivation. My therapist would point out my good results and I'd lament: ""I've won... but at what cost?"". Every bone in my body aches and I feel like I'm close to having a heart attack.

My mom passed away in my second year, and about a week before she passed she was balling her eyes out at me saying 'your brother took your teenage years away from you and now I'm gonna take your 20s and your education when I die' (brother had a fatal traffic accident and mom had terminal cancer). She knew I was depressed/grieving from my bro (and could see the knock on effects had permeated all aspects of my life) and that I never dealt with it so she knew that her condition was adding to it.
The cancer was not her fault, and it broke her heart to think that I would not graduate because... so I fuckin made sure that I did!
It's only a 2:2, but in my head, its worth more than a first. I was on track for a first before the shit hit the fan so in my heart I know I could have got a first if i didnt have to take 6 weeks off. 
Clearly on paper and in a job interview it's not, and I accept that, but recruiters dont take life conditons into account when they discriminate between candidates so fuck them too. 
Thoughts go to the OP if you are struggling. Time and keeping your head busy will see you through to better times!",Depressed
"Okay my degrees was ten years ago now but I do remember setting hard goals.  Eg: the word count of essay assignments was divided by the number of weeks until due and I'd write that many words each week even if we hadn't covered the material yet: just getting the word count done would keep me going.  Each week's material for each unit had a single page of notes.  My best tip was that, with each term going for twelve weeks, I'd divide a piece of paper into six, and every week I'd put into one of those squares the five or ten most important things of the week.  By exam my anxiety was peaking but I already had the cheat sheet done and could remind myself that, as I know everything on this one piece of paper, I'm definitely going to pass.  I always did.",Depressed
"Personally suffering from anxiety and depression gives me the push. I’ve always had high standards for myself and I always kind of put my worth on grades. I know that’s an extremely bad thing for mental health, but it is how I grew up. I would feel very worthless and upset at myself if I didn’t have a grade high enough. I used to beat myself up and take all the blame because I wasn’t working hard enough. I’m in my second year of university right now, and this year I broke down. Because of my depression, some days I went to bed straight from classes, didn’t eat, didn’t study, and just slept until the morning when I had to get up. I felt extremely guilty doing this, because I could be using my time to write an essay, or complete an assignment. But instead I just slept away the precious time. But the anxiety side and my fear of failing/disappointment kept me going I guess. It is not a good mix to have both illnesses but I guess this might be an advantage. There were times where I can stare at a page of notes and burst into tears for 30 minutes because I couldn’t bring myself to focus. The guilt is tremendous for me and sometimes I have to give in because well, depression wins.",Depressed
"I know how I did it. I was in such a denial, dissociated and suppressed emotional state due to bullying trauma that got under the rug so deep I didn’t get any flashbacks just physical symptoms I was handling on general doctors that I didn’t even almost register I was having a major depression. And so I stood there in a limbo thinking something was wrong but couldn’t exactly figure it out, and not even thinking about therapists/psychiatrists I later was forced to go due to meltdown 5 years after I finished the course and got into the job market.",Depressed
I just do it because my parents want good grades.,Depressed
None of you people understand. You say it gave you validation. Well theres no structure or support now with coronavirus and I'm going to get terrible grades anyway. I'm just a worthless piece of trash,Depressed
Summer terms were a bit of a struggle. Every time I would think if I really wanted to keep on living and tthere was any meaning to the effort.,Depressed
I didn't even completed high school :(,Depressed
I am asking myself that question at every end of a semester. How the hell did I finish everything without jumping out of a window? It feels like an autopilot took over any get thinks done. I am so lucky that I am from Europe where university education is free. If I fuck up it would only cost me years of life but if Americans fuck up they are in deep debt.,Depressed
"I relate so much, I just started my degree, which I love, but I cant seem to do any work simce quarantine and it sucks. My dream is to get a phd, but how will I get there if I cant do any work.

Good luck with everything",Depressed
"I have both a BA and an MA. When it comes to motivation, I either had none or it was very low. I'd have anxiety attacks every time I had to submit a major assignment or project when the deadline was approaching and I either didn't get started or I wasn't near the finish crossing line.",Depressed
"hey man. i know you've got a lost of responses already, but i just wanted to let you know that i took a long time to do graduate. failed 3 semesters because of exactly the reasons you mentioned in your post. ended up having to extend uni by a year, and even then, i only just barely made it with my gpa slightly above cutoff. it's been really, really tough. but it's possible. i don't know if this post is about you, but if it is, you got this. hang in there. go to therapy, talk to people. connect with your professors. some of them will be helpful, some won't. but we need all the help we can get.",Depressed
"Ah good ol’ depression in undergrad. I know it very well, but I managed. 

I was never the smart kid with the highest GPA in high school and people kinda saw me like that. And I wanted to prove them wrong when I come home. I viewed college as an opportunity to use the next four years to put myself in situations I can grow and learn from.

Some classes Had ton of group projects and you have a shitty team. It kept me busy enough to keep working so I wouldn’t be in bed moping to myself. 

For the difficult classes, study with a friend or something. I hate group studying because it always ends up all conversation and no work, but encourage them to just be productive along with you. Nowadays, I just FaceTime someone. They’re working, I’m studying, we’re all productive!

I find that the more you can keep busy, like club involvements or studying with friends, it makes college more manageable. Just do your best to not be alone in your room. That’s where thoughts can get dark...like really dark...",Depressed
"It worked for a year when it was new. The idea of having a goal got me through it. But now like literally everything I've ever tried in my bloody life, I lost interest, got bored and now I get all my work done in the last few days before the deadline fuelled by stress alone. I get them in but barely.

The course was supposed to give me a job that didn't make me want to kill myself, now the thought of getting a job in that field feels like too much so I no longer have any reason to be on the course. But its too late to switch, I've got a whole other year left, the course feels boring as hell and at the end of it I'm going to be stuck in the same place where I started. Unable to work because every job I've ever gotten has made me want to kill myself.",Depressed
I was diagnosed with depression my freshmen year of college & now I’m completing my master’s degree. I did it by 1) SSRI’s 2) asking for extensions 3) lots of therapy 4) on the days I would wake up and not feel like dying I would take it and run with it. I would do as much as I could in that day because I knew it would wear off.,Depressed
"I'm talking in my own point of view.
I'm finishing highschool (hopefully) this year. What I learned was, even tho it's hard, I didn't let depression come in the way of my success. I did that by gaining self discipline and just realising that I have depression, depression doesn't have me, I did what I could to fight against it. Believe me, I know it's fucking hard, but you can do it!",Depressed
I have absolutely no other options so I just keep my GPA high enough to not get kicked out. The only reason I've been able to do that is because my school alters your grades when you're depressed instead of providing accommodations.,Depressed
Beats me. I can't function,Depressed
"The only saving grace I had was knowing that I would be \*even more depressed\* if I didn't graduate on time. My motivation was to get out as soon as possible, because I would be prolonging my suffering in uni if I didn't. It makes sense on a utilitarian level, but man those were the worst years of life thus far.",Depressed
"Hi. Okay firstly, I'd like to add a disclaimer saying that I am not a health professional and I'm just a first year uni student studying clinical pharmacology aka drugs, clinical trials and all that. Personally, I think you shouldn't have gone off your meds cold turkey and should've slowly lowered the dose but that's in the past. 

As for weed, I smoke it every so often and it can make me feel more relaxed, though it can make some people really down and make things worse. But maybe try it out if you're interested. But not everyone needs medication even though they're depressed. I'm not saying you don't need it or that you do, I just don't want you to feel too dependent on it. In my opinion, I think therapy is defo the way to go for the long-run. It seems like your therapist wasn't really what you were looking for and it happens. Maybe try looking for a new one who can give you advice or try to unpack your issues rather than just being a cheerleader. Good luck.",Depressed
"Don't do it, no it just makes everything worse in the long run. And by long run I mean one week till everything goes downhill.",Depressed
"No no no no don't do it... I have scars left and this shit isn't funny, now I'm always wearing long sleeve hoodies, just don't try it",Depressed

Not if you want to scratch at your scabs like a coked out druggy also no that’s pretty retarded but don’t take my word for it bc I’m kinda retarded myself,Depressed
No,Depressed
I started cutting myself like three weeks ago. I want to keep doing it but it doesn't do anything. So don't start doing it. It doesn't do anything for you except hurting you. Trust me i speak from experience.,Depressed
"No. Don’t do it.

In the past, I thought about a lot of different ways to self harm.

Because I didn’t want to raise any red flags to anyone and bring any more unwanted attention to myself, I avoided cutting. People would see that on my wrists.

So, I took up drinking as a way to make myself feel better and ease the pain.

As good as it may feel in the moment, you’re going to want to come back to do it again.

And again.

And again.

And each time you come back, you’re going to want to do it more than the last time.

Hell, even if you did it the same amount or less than the last time, you’re still doing it. It’s not healthy. It’s not good for you. And you know it’s not, which is why you’re on here asking all of us. Which is a good thing. Because you haven’t started doing it yet. Because once you start doing it, it’s hard to stop. It’s like drugs: the more or the longer you do them, the deeper and harder it is to stop.

And I know it’s hard as fuck to not do any of that because especially in the moment you’d do anything to make yourself feel better. But it’s not worth it. If you could look into the future, you’d see that it only sets you back and puts you in a worse position than you were originally in. Please trust me.

Much love and peace.",Depressed
"I’ve heard a good alternative can be to take a red marker and draw lines on your arm, i haven’t tried it myself but maybe it can help you out, good luck and I’m sorry to hear you’ve been feeling this way",Depressed

"See a shrink? Could be PTSD. Truth is a bad trip isn't the only thing that can mess with your mind, there have been kids who became suicidal while taking a philosophy degree, fake shooting pranks, bumping into their childhood bully. Acid trips more than enough to traumatize you, especially in a room you can't get out of that fucking feels like it breaks the rules of physics. That is a literal mind fuck. See someone. Professional. Who actually knows how to deal with this. Don't let one bad trip ruin your life.",Depressed

We just gotta keep going, no matter how bad things look or feel.

Nothing like some random internet encouragement to boost some spirits:)",Depressed
"You don't sound arrogant at all, don't worry about it. 

As someone who is an undergrad in college too (and was also depressed during the beginning of my freshman year), that transition from feeling alone to formulating close relationships is something that I went through personally. It can definitely happen.

The best thing about college is that you are able to meet so many different people, to the point that it is an impossibility that there is not a whole group of people out there who click with you. You already have someone you love and (hopefully) someone who loves you; you're already making a connection a lot of people at your school would envy themselves! Have hope, because there's definite still reason for you to hold onto it. Wish you luck with your friends and studies.",Depressed
I'm 22 and I've been feeling like that for 5 years now. I chose my major because I wasn't bad at it and I didn't hate it. I'm kinda dreading graduation because I don't know what happens after.,Depressed
"First of all, a job doesn't necessarily give you ""a point."" It's just a way to provide for yourself. It doesn't have to bigger than that. I'd argue none of us have a point. Life itself is pointless. At least you have a boyfriend and if he loves you, that's more important than any job to me at least. 

I read a book called the Pathfinder and it helped me make the decision of what career field I pursued. There is a scoring system that helps you make your decision. There are probably a number of career paths you'd do just fine in, but you have to pick one. This book gave me the confidence to pick one and just stick with it. At the end of the day though, it's just a job. Your family will be most important. 

Thirdly, you are not arrogant. Lots of people have these problems and it helps to talk about them. 

Fourthly, you're not excited about the future. It could very well suck. Everyone has different opinions but I'll give you mine. Read that Pathfinder and whatever it tells you should do, do it. Love your boyfriend and eventually you'll have a family together. I'd say just having him is enough to be excited about the future. 


God bless,


Jim",Depressed
I feel this,Depressed
I know how you feel. I have those thoughts a lot as well and if I changed one thing In the past my life might actually be a lot better or I could be dead right now if I did change it lol. Going back to change the past is dangerous cos even if you try to save a life something in your life might change as well and it could kill you. It's best to not think about our past mistakes too much and focus on the future cos we can only change the future by what we do in the present.,Depressed
I wish I could change my past with no consequences though :(,Depressed
"Mentally it's important too. It's like a microcosm and a sanitary way of showing how the world is hyper-competitive and you absolutely need that mentality to get ahead in life. You need to experience loss, be frustrated enough to have an alpha and winning mentality, and work with others and ""utilize"" them for success. It really should be mandatory if you're a mild-mannered person. I wish I could go back in the past and tell myself to get involved in sports at a very young age. I might've turned out in a better circumstance than I am in now. I'm not saying it can solve problems down the line--I'm sure many here are suffering even though they were involved in sports--but I think it conditions you (mentally and physically as you say) for the world and further challenges in your life.",Depressed
"I can completely feel you. Always late to start learning things and when the exams and deadlines come I fall into this loop of how impossible it is, learning even less and so on.
Currently struggling with subject where you need a ton of prior knowledge I don't have and it really sucks because I had to spend much more time onto this and now it's too late or maybe it was always too late I don't even know. There is no hope so I'm thinking let's focus on other subjects and maybe get this somehow done in the future.
I'm definitely not a person who should give an advice there but maybe you could also focus on parts that you know best, so you have at least something to build on and then dealing with the rest later, if you have the option of course.
Just try to not get stuck in this depression hole doing absolutely nothing. Yea, it's SUPER HARD I know, but you have to try.",Depressed
"I don't know if this will help much, but try to study bit by bit every day. I know it's hard, been there too. Try to think only about yourself and your goals. You're doing this for yourself.

Try to organize your desk and make the studying more fun by writing the most important things with highlighters and maybe some doodles. Listen to nice music that will lift your spirits up.

tbh i feel the same way. i see no future anymore.,Depressed
"You're a real person and the things you are feeling are real, too. Never feel bad for feeling the way you naturally do. Nobody here can diagnose you with depression outright, but you should absolutely consider cataloging the things you're feeling, not dismissing them as ""cries for attention"", and speaking to your doctor to get referred to a professional if its impacting your life. I can relate to the lack of motivation, and the only way I was ever able to make a dent in fixing it was by asking for help from others, and there's never any shame in doing so. Good luck :)",Depressed

If I could make one recommendation, find the easiest thing on your to-do list, and just force yourself to do it. Then find the next easiest and do that too. Take a shower, tidy up your living space, keep life moving forward in small increments, no matter how slowly, and forgive yourself for the lack of motivation.

Maybe I have a very adolescent way of coping, but when I listen to sad music and read sad books it’s cathartic and relatable.  Mitski is incredible sad music that is dynamic and I can crank it to max volume (which is kind of silly).  My Year of Rest and Relaxation by  
Ottessa Moshfegh is a book about a depressed millennial who feels incredibly sad, and she is sure that if she could just sleep for a year she would be fine.  Sad movies *really* don’t work for me because I end up dwelling.",Depressed

Took me over a year to figure out drugs didn't work for me, another year after that to find a therapist that worked for me.

"Interesting, I always thought racism was just hate. Never thought about it being an inner struggle. I guess you are right. You have bad thoughts and blame others for 'stealing' your good  life. Truth is that skin color doesn´t steel. Maybe you had an experience with some bad individuals and you hate them. Society just makes you hate everyone that resembles them. 

We are all individuals and have more things in common then white people from let's say: Russia. Try to think from their perspective. What did they ever steel from you? Land that wasn´t even personally owned by you? The same right of freedom you like so much? They didn´t steel anything. But they are born with an appearance a lot of people hate them for. Of course they think you stole from them since you still won´t give them equal chances. 

Stop trying to focus so much on society and try to think more about your personal well being. Murdering someone or spouting racist threats is the absolute worst you can do. That is not an option. If you actually want to kill a person living a good life, a person who has done nothing wrong because your are ill then yes, you should do whatever it takes to stop yourself. However everyone can change maybe you even changed a tad bit after reading this comment.",Depressed
"I'm a mixed child of a white mom and a brown dad. From what ive learned from both families is that racism is used by both sides to make it easier to be friends with their own or but its also mostly due to racism being around so predominantly when they were younger causing it to leak into their personality. You shouldn't hate yourself just because you realised you have a flaw we all have flaws and they all take many different shapes and forms. But we don't live life based on our flaws we live because we want to see that new movie with friends or try that food from Europe. But all in all remember we all need to feel emotions, our body just likes to make excuses for those emotions all the time and those excuses can take a negative form. But id recommend maybe a change of scenery and surroundings because when you surround yourself by evil its a lot easier to become evil,so maybe head down to new orleans and see why mardi gras is so crazy. Also a huge thing I forgot about is that we all think, see, and feel the world differently because of our cultural backgrounds so see why other cultures love their own style. I'd recommend trying to get to know people through the food they eat it can tell you a lot, plus its hard to have a bad day with a damn good meal",Depressed

"There's quite a lot to unpack there... First, it's a very complicated to say something about your mother's behaviour. It's not up to me to say anything about how she chooses to raise her children. All I can say is: that's not the way I would go about it. But I don't have children, so I can't put it to the test. I don't agree with what she's doing but I also have only access to your side of the story. Please, I'm not invalidating what you wrote here. Were you to ever confront her about those attitudes, I would tell you to do it in a non-aggressive way. She will very likely reasons better if you can calmly show her how it makes you feel. That you don't like so you would ask her not to do it anymore. An aggressive approach will hit you back with another one grim her side, you know. Assertiveness us always a better solution than aggressiveness. I learned it way too late in life. 

Now, about your SO. I think a relationship has to be based on trust. There's a million reasons she might be online after she said goodnight to you. She might be talking to friends about random things. She might be working on something from school and talking to classmates about it. She might be doing something else but from time to time checks her phone (I do that all the time because I don't always hear the sound of new messages or something). My point is: your gonna drive yourself crazy if you keep thinking about it. Specially because everything will be nothing other than speculations. And, mate, those thoughts are a bitch. They might even start as a mild annoyance, but if we keep feeding them, they can become huge paranoia. It's not unusual for someone your age to have those insecurities about their SO. But keep in mind they do have a life of their own as well. If it bothers you so much and there's the possibility, try taking to her about it. Again, calmly, exposing how you feel, careful with your words so they don't give the impression you're putting your insecurities as her responsibility, because they're not. There's a bit of controlling behaviour on your part, checking on if she's online or not. Since you told about your mom's attitudes, I guess you're telling us where this might be coming from. But if you don't work on it, THIS might be the reason you will struggle in your relationships. It might even become a greater issue in your life. As we get older (I'm in my 40s) we start to learn that any control we try to have (not only on relationships but pretty much everything in life) is very fragile. It's more an illusion thank anything real. We also learn that a true, meaningful relationship can only be built on trust and good communication. It's not easy. I still struggle with the communication part. So start working on it earlier than me and you might do way better than me. I hope you can work all this out with the best outcome possible for you.",Depressed

Today, I have things that I want to do and I work towards becoming that dream person, so I think this habit is harmless now

I do think you should talk about this with your therapist and maybe you should try to reduce the daydreaming if you think it is doing harm to you",Depressed
"Sounds like how it goes for me, i spend a lot of time daydreaming, makes me think of an alternate timeline where my life isn't shit and people didn't hate me.",Depressed
"Yeah I do this too except I’m alone on a space-station, Earth has been destroyed and I randomly pick up a mans voice on my communicator, and I have robot friends. Its been going on for years now. Reality is shit. Im so glad I can escape, even if it isn’t real.",Depressed
Yes. I do it almost everyday . Reality is just too hard for me.,Depressed
"I used to do this constantly 6 years ago. I'd just lay in bed all day and think of my own happy world. I'm sad to say that I've fallen back to it recently because things feel miserable and hopeless again. I know however that it's unhealthy, so I'll simply give myself some time. And then I'll get back on track to continue improving my life in the aspects that obviously need fixing.",Depressed
How do you know this reality isn’t just a daydream?,Depressed
I wish I could do this. I did have a lovely dream right after being verbally harassed by my parents for being gay. I was on this soft cloud on the edge of a cliff just staring into space and the night sky was so beautiful. I wish I could go back and just lie there forever,Depressed
"i did this often in the worst times. im getting close to that again. maybe its not me, just quarantine, but i cant with reality right now.",Depressed
"Hmm, can relate.  I had an extension to my budget file that I spent many thousands of hours on, it was what I'd do if I came into an appalling amount of money.  It was so, so complex.  Anytime I was down I'd open it up and create a new layer of what I'd do if money were no object.  After years I realised that I could do a lot of these things already: most of the things I wanted to try didn't need that appalling amount of money.  I don't regret the time I spent on them, like I don't regret the time I've spent getting lost in a game.  But maybe incorporate into your daydream, arcs that remove the people you've invented, and arcs that centre around things that you can make happen in your real life, like it's your vision board or your affirmation or something.",Depressed
"Same. Just a bright future where I get through school with flying colors, a good job, a loving SO and fuck it I think of kids sometimes as well. Meanwhile I’m actually just a fat fuck who sits around feeling sorry for himself. I don’t think anyone likes me. 

The daydreaming let’s me think that there’s a chance that life may get better but then I just think a little deeper and then boom. I start laughing. Not to myself, but at myself for thinking that it might happen or that I even deserve it. 

Shits tough. Anyway I don’t think it’s very healthy either but it’s all we’ve got, no?",Depressed
"I know what you mean. I also have my fantasy world where I escape alot to. But it's more fantasy-like, for example, being a pilot in Star Wars and so on. I can't tell you if that's a healthy coping mechanism tho... I would say yea and no.",Depressed
"Depends on the situation. If they will handle it poorly and you know this then you will only be caused more stress. On the other hand if they will understand and be supportive for sure tell them. I would recommend that you start talking to you University counselor and she can help you out. Even if all she does is officially recognize the depression that could help too. My family didn't take me seriously until I was officially diagnosed.

Just make sure that you do whatever you need to out of strength and not weakness. Don't wait until you are going to lose them, let them know responsibly",Depressed
"me too. i just feel like im waiting until i dont want to -you know-. today all i did was be a good person and get attacked buy some lame idiots on twitter who cant read. i dont feel like eating all day. i cried and still felt shitty. i hate feeling shitty. i cant tell if its worse when you feel like crying every second or cant cry at all (just kidding, we both know which is worse). i took a crappy depression poem from last year and made it astounding. too bad no one will ever pay attenion to it (im ok with that). but i listened to wait a minute! by willow smith and trip switch by nothing but thieves (great songs) and i didnt sleep the whole night watching h2o and the originals. h2o is free on youtube if u want. but those are only distractions to cheer you up- make sure someone knows how you feel. family, friends, idk. you deserve some help",Depressed
"Thanks. I try to share but I just feel like I am being a burden to people. Feeling sad all the time. I feel they are getting tired of me too and I understand them.

"Maybe if you all talk to her it'll help. It seems like you're in a really tough situation. I dont know that I'd have the best advice but I understand your feelings on neglect and I hope you can talk to her about this and get things worked out.

Edit to add: it can be hard talking to a family member though about things like neglect. I've often had fights and its not always an easy thing to traverse but I hope it goes well.",Depressed
"To be honest, the signs are pretty odvious once you've understood them. Yes, feelings of external dread and hopelessness, and or alongside overly emotional feelings and reactions to the world around you are the signs of depression. What is the next thing you are wondering if this is a case. 

This is the disclaimer everyone has to have when talking about this, I'm no doctor I can't confirm it. But I would say it's no doubt.",Depressed
I'm not a professional but it's very likely you have mdd or something else like PTSD or manic depression or both. I would definitely talk to someone about what you're experiencing. Think about anything in your past or about your physical condition and make a list to talk to your doctor and counselor about.,Depressed

Do you want to try a new hobby maybe? Sry this is the best advice I can give.",Depressed
"This all sounds incredibly tough. I know most of the feelings that you share here and they're terrible to have to occupying your life. Coexisting with them is just fucking terrible.

I get that you might not want to be here right now and escapism or even thinking about suicide (I do that often) is all in all a common enough road to take. You're not alone in that, hard as it is.

You don't have to try this at all, but I think one of the thing that helps me is getting little sensory bleeps. Like drinking super cold juice from the fridge (I love juice so much I've been meaning to get it tattooed) or eating spicy food and sweating from it (my nose starts running too which feels ridiculous and always takes me out of my zone a little). 
It's not like it's gonna cure your depression in any way (it hasn't for me!), but it might make it less shit even momentarily. And hey, I think you deserve that.

Time is the greatest element to heal your pain, in the meanwhile occupy your mind and try some new things that you have always wanted to experience. Don’t depend on others for your happiness, give yourself the help no one ever gave to you. Take care of yourself, eat well and fight against the world for yourself.

"I’m confused by this therapist, and I feel so terrible you had that experience, I can promise you that is atypical. I wonder what her reasoning was for insisting CBT wouldn’t “work” for you, or if she thought a different type of therapy would be helpful?  Honestly, you’re going to have to find another one to have a consult with.  Most people don’t like their first therapist anyway! It takes a little!  And it’s so important. 

Pills aside, therapy changed my life. My medication (I went in because I thought I was majorly depressed, found out I was as bipolar) helps me a lot, but that is not what’s given me my drive or quality of life back- therapy has.  However, still grateful for my medication 100%, being a little more stabilized has made my life easier. 

If you think or know you need medication or could benefit from it, you’re probably not wrong. You are the only expert of your situation.  And yes, medication can give you back that quality of life, but you also have to put in the work and also not expect too much, and accept that it’s a trial and error journey to find the right medication or combo of meds. I say work because antidepressants aren’t just something you take that makes you happy and that’s it- they just take the depth out of your sadness, emptiness, etc, which is why therapy is so important.  You’ll still have to “accept your personality”, but accepting it is important, and then you can work on it.",Depressed
"I’m sorry that I can’t console or “hold” you during your rough times, I’d ask if you wanna talk but you’ve already stated your opinion on talking while your going through your problems.",Depressed

Your worries are completely understandable since you're right at the start of a life-changing experience, but try to trust that everything will fall in place by the time it comes. I think you need to give yourself permission to be a little vulnerable to others, though. There are going to be people who will help you through this, but you need to let them.",Depressed
There are several quizzes that therapists use to determine if you're in the range.   If you so a Google search youll find them.,Depressed

You get assessed by a mental health professional,Depressed
"Depression is often not explained, and one of the reasons why this may be the case is because you have fundamental hormonal abnormalities which are affecting your mood--along with other potential factors.

Consider going to a psychiatrist and/or having your doctor examine your blood work if you haven't already. There generally is a ""reason"" for depression, and you need to figure that out as soon as possible if you want to overcome this. Wish you the best of luck.",Depressed

"Hey friend, I’m really glad you’re taking the first steps to getting help. I don’t know your current condition or location, but I would suggest consulting a local therapist or professional online therapy if you are able to. You need professional guidance in resolving your troubled past. If you are unable to, confide in your family and loved ones. I can assure you most nearly everyone cares for and wants you to be better, but they may not truly understand the problems you have.

"Please try professional help. I don't know you, but you may search for abusive relationships, because it's the only thing you've know until now. Try getting help to make you realise, that you're capable of having a good and healthy life.

Please, don't think about taking yourself out of the world. We all have value and it doesn't have to stay the way it is now. There's always another day to think about commiting suicide, but it doesn't have to be today. Just don't give up before you have explored all options.",Depressed
Seems like it,Depressed
"Trauma, especially from an early age, creates somewhat of a blueprint for you moving forward to have particular thoughts, emotions, reactions, beliefs, etc. in response to particular situations, people, relationships, and so on. 


I believe that, for example, someone who experienced a type of abuse may find themselves caught in that cycle. I think it boils down to that person (the partner) validating your inner feelings about yourself. There is comfort in this scenario because it’s what you know; it’s your reality. It’s scary to be with someone who treats you differently than what you are used to. You believe you can’t trust them. Or, you believe you don’t deserve them. Or, you believe they will eventually see the darkness inside you and abandon you. 



So, I think that yes, people who have been abused may unknowingly or knowingly seek partners who continue the cycle that they are used to. It takes tremendous effort to try to create a new reality for yourself.",Depressed
"It's not your fault!

The last thing you need to do is blame yourself. The essence of what you're saying is, ""I'm the problem"". But that itself is the problem. We should never blame *who we are*. At most we should blame *what we do*, and maybe there's some things you could improve, some better people you could surround yourself with.

But it's *not* a matter of you being ""no good"" or anything. You are *not* somehow less deserving of love and respect than others. And it is *not* somehow your ""destiny"" to seek out people like this.

"I was in a relationship for some years with a girl who was abused badly several times in her life. She picked abusers as partners regularly and it made me so desperately sad and worried for her seeing her repeat the cycle of her childhood.

When I spoke to my therapist about it he said that some people who suffered childhood abuse pick abusers for partners because it’s a relationship they know and understand. Sometimes something you don’t know can be scarier than travelling once again down a well trodden path. We find ways to survive and get along within a framework that’s ‘comfortable’ in life. For my ex girlfriend I think she didn’t know how to respond with me when I wouldn’t hurt her no matter how much she tried to provoke me. Even when she used to hit me sometimes I never raised my voice even; but it seemed to make her only more depressed and angry. I think I understand her a little better now in hindsight but at the time it was desperately confusing.",Depressed

Then he does too saying he's in the same situation. Then barely a week later he has a girlfriend and tells me how he likes his friends from out of town more than the ones from our school.

I even used to make sure every day I got a Facebook notification about someone’s birthday, I would wish them a happy birthday, even if we weren’t that close. I did this in the hope that they would return the favour when it was my bday....but nope, I have gotten none for a few years now.

The year prior, my birthday fell on a Sunday so I went to church.

You shouldn’t go through this. It’s so nice of you to stick by someone’s side but your boyfriend is an asshole when he’s upset. I would leave.,Depressed
"I understand what you are going through and I also understand what he’s going through. Depression doesn’t just make you sad, it turns all the negative emotions super extreme. When you feel sad, you get super sad. When you get angry, you get super angry. Your emotions and feelings are extremely sensitive and explosive. It makes you do things you regret and you black out. You are so strong being his rock rn, but just so you know it’s okay to leave him if you can’t handle it anymore. Don’t hold yourself responsible for him. Don’t forget you have yourself to take care of. I hope you both grow and heal. Please updates on your journey ❤️",Depressed
"I’m not sure if this helps but I’ve been in the same situation before. Any time I talk about my depression people stop talking to me. But sometimes you find the right person and they won’t stop talking to you, those are the sort of people you want to associate with, people that lift you up, people that understand sometimes when you go silent or MIA that all you need is someone to be there. Sending hugs friend.",Depressed
"I feel the exact same way, im in a similar situation.",Depressed
"My mental health and coming to terms with my childhood has meant a great deal of time shutting myself indoors and hiding from the world. There's whole years of time I have no recollection of.   I didnt want or need this time shut inside.
People that say that shit about enjoying it can step back.  I didnt enjoy it the first few times so why would I enjoy this one!?! 
I have energy at the minute.  I do worry that when this all dies down I'll have another breakdown or something and I'll be hiding again.",Depressed
"Same. I cannot, for the life of me, find ANY motivation to get ANYTHING done.",Depressed
Do you feel pressure in your head,Depressed
"And how frustrating it can be when you find the courage to open up to a dear friend but they just round up all your years of torment into a single phrase, 'its just a phase' or 'you need to be more positive' or worse 'yeah everyone feels like that bro'.",Depressed
"I felt this post in my very being. Sorry if this is too personal a question, but do you think something happened that severely impacted your motivation? I'm able to look back now and identify moments in my life that screwed up my motivation and hard working attitude. Maybe if your able to do the same you can make positive steps to get that motivation back. 

For me it was coming to terms with the fact that others have used my hard working and forgiving nature against me. My ex gf abused me for 5yrs, she knew i would work hard and make sacrifices for her. She literally abused me and my reaction was i needed to work harder to appease her, but the abuse never stopped no matter how hard i worked or what i sacrificed along the way. In order to cope with it all, I basically ran myself into the ground. I never saw friends or did anything for myself in order to stop the guilt and abuse. I just ran myself into the ground thinking my degree would make it all worthwhile. It did not, i'm 26 and with the world the way it is, basically unemployable. I know i will never be able to work that hard again, and knowing that even when i did work that hard and sold my soul in order to do so, but got absolutely no reward at all, crushed any motivation to ever work hard again. Other shit happened too like being reduced to 3 days a week at my first job post uni, my dad having a heart scare after i told him i wanted to drop out of my masters programme. Then to round it all off my friend of 20 yrs made my abusive rl worse when he told his gf about how i was questioning the rl and she told my abusive ex.",Depressed
"Yeah, and if you try to tell everyone you get told to man up or ""just find goals bro"", ""just self improve"".",Depressed
"Yeh same here, I was able to d’ATM up and do something a few weeks ago, no it’s just bottom down, i ve get cold shakes and random headaches every hour or so for the last 5 weeks",Depressed
"Hey OP, don’t put yourself down regretting the decisions you’ve made and worrying about the future. You are a highly capable individual, achieving a Masters in computer science is a highly commemorable achievement and you should feel proud for working so hard even if you’re not satisfied with your current situation.

Don’t blame yourself or anyone for the choices in the past, that’s over. You sound like you’re confident and known what or where you want to be, and everyone knows you’re more than capable of taking the right steps to get there. Be more assertive and trust yourself more, it is more than possible to restart and introduce yourself to a new industry you’re passionate in or interested at any age, especially at 28 years young. You have your entire life ahead of you, and life will be better so long as you’re working with the best you’ve got and never let the world keep you down.

Friends will come, but It is more important to love and care for oneself first before trying to build something with others. You’re more than strong enough to handle this, wishing you the best!",Depressed
"would be really peculiar if he did it purposefully, ringing bell, so he could be missed after he's gonne",Depressed
">Don’t take away your inevitability to get better. Just stick through all the bullshit that will make you much stronger.

Personally I think I've regressed physically and mentally as a result of sticking through the bullshit.",Depressed
"Depression is pretty sneaky in that it makes us paranoid without realizing it. Has there been any indication that your friends actually don't like you, or are you only thinking this way because you're afraid of rejection?

Your friends deserve the benefit of the doubt. If there is no evidence for them not liking you, take the risk and reach out. I guarantee you, that if your friends are real ones, they'll be happy to talk to you and I promise you'll feel a lot better! Wish you the best.",Depressed
"My friend called me once ssying he wanted to kill himself, i listened to him, i did everything i could, he didnt end up kiling himself, and now tht i try to tell him about my depresion, he always ingores me, like WTF",Depressed
"As hard as it is, I think opening up to your parents is a good idea. It may not seem like it, but hopefully they'll be able to get the help you need. From the sounds of it, I don't think you're in the United States, but if there's a text line or hotline you can call, someone might be able to help you deal with this given that your school does not provide mental health resources. 

I think getting a therapist would be a good step after that, to help you work through your thoughts, etc. As for actually opening up, maybe try opening up to a friend first and possibly going to your parents together so they can realize that it isn't just all in your head and that it's affecting your schoolwork and that other people (your friends, teachers, etc.) are noticing as well. It probably will be a tough conversation, but ultimately necessary if you want to get the help you need. 

If they don't understand, there are some resources online and you could also bring it up with your PCP (primary care physician or main doctor) and have them explain depression to your parents. They should be able to help as well. Best of luck, OP. I hope things go well.",Depressed
"I'm so glad you opened up to your dad! So proud of you! It is a crazy hard first step trusting someone else with our struggle and hurt. It sounds like you're doing better, and you're starting a path to gaining support instead of trying to handle everything on your own. That is so great! Congratulations!",Depressed
"The tipical i am older, therefore i know more, pretty much adults think likes thay",Depressed
"Yes, my depression can sometimes get worse at night or when I'm tired as well, but I agree, it can also keep me up at night with racing thoughts. Some things that can help getting a better nights sleep are:

* not napping during the day
* stop using electronics/screens an hour or two before going to bed 
* going to bed at the same time every night
* avoiding caffeine, alcohol and smoking before bedtime

Melatonin is also an option if you need a medication for sleep aid and can be found without a prescription in most places.

As far as punching yourself, it could be unintentional self harm, though I think it's best to bring that up with a doctor or therapist, as I honestly am not sure. The amount of time you do it and for how hard is also a factor to bring up as well.",Depressed
"Yes that's self Harm. It's OK, it's also one of my coping tools, I generally starve myself and let my personal hygiene go to self harm. Some people cut, others sabotage their relationships. Lots of self harm methods out there.

As far as being tired that's not usually a issue for me as when I get into a low time depression wise I generally spend most of my free time sleeping as I have no motivation to do anything else and my two cats are pretty good at curling up in my arms in bed and purring me to sleep. Only downside to this is it upsets the SO because she almost never sees me, but, as I've mentioned to her a few times now when I'm that low she probably doesn't want to spend time with me anyways.

But, to directly answer your question, yes, my depression is worse when I am tired, I think just because I don't have as much mental energy to fight back as when I'm fully awake and well slept.",Depressed
Oh my. Well you should tell us first what could be The reason behind your depression. It could be sth like mental abuse or A loss. With ur problem acknowledged it would be easier to help u and get rid of depression. Communication is very important in the case of depression especially a long term one,Depressed

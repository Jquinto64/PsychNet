But I will never, not in a million years, clean up anyone's shit. I thank all the janitors & custodians who can, but I can't do something so dehumanizing.

I have to pay someone to listen to all my problems and all my flawed thinking and they give me coping strategies and listen and make me feel understood. But ultimately I leave knowing that I will never be cured and all my hard work will at most make me feel  okay and not neurotypical or “normal.” \n",

I was a pretty negative person in my younger years and was a compulsive liar and manipulative because I felt like I had to use these schemes in order to get people to like me and stay.

It was easier to live in a fake world with my ideal self even if it was lies than address my true self which I found to be horrible.\n",

I somehow got married and have a great partner. But I don’t feel comfortable talking to my friends about my issues and feel alienated from them as they don’t really know what I’m going through. Even when friends open up, I use humor to hide my own feelings or focus on them. I find it impossible to truly open up to people unless it’s been years and even then I fear they will be repulsed by who I am. I find it hard to talk to my partner. They know about my past and my mental illness and all my trauma. They have seen my breakdowns and my worst moments. But I’m sick of the “it gets better” platitudes and the “I’m here for you” BS. It’s tiring. And it doesn’t help. So I save it all for my therapist. \n",

I’m ashamed of my “relapse” (read as: failing to do my therapy work like coping strategies, not taking care of myself, using weed to escape, etc). I’m scared to tell the truth of how I feel because I don’t want to be medicated against my will. I already take medication for other health conditions. And I just don’t want to do it. And I don’t want to be taken in for a psych evaluation or anything like that.\n",

That I didn’t have to spend hours of my life and thousands of dollars to just talk to someone about how pathetic I am. That I didn’t have anxiety around people and could be really open with friends. That I could be free and live a life worth living.  I wish so much. And it will probably never happen.

Now I do care about people again but not to the extent that I'd twist myself into a tangle expecting things from them again. If you have to scale down your expectations for a bit to make things easier for yourself, it's okay to do that even if other people think differently. They might think less of you, but so what? You're the one going through this after all. Will their words do your work for you? Nah. Only you can do it. You're great to make it this far, the effort you put didn't just evaporate into thin air because you're struggling. The distance you traveled wouldn't be reversed because you're stumbling, you'll just take some more time, maybe do some detour, but you're still walking and that's a fact! Even if you stop for a while, doesn't mean you're giving up or that you won't continue again. So good luck, pal, and give yourself a breather, think about how you want to go about this and whether you want to continue, or take a different path, not because of others, but because it's what you want for yourself.\n",

      "I know it sucks, but you gotta be you, and that's gotta be enough. I think my depression post high school was triggered in part because of the expectations laid upon me. I didn't want them anymore, and I had to confront that. It took a few years to get through this; I basically had to kill off the person everyone wanted me to be so I could find the real me. And it was pretty fast and brutal. Right after coming out, I embraced my inner wanderer, gave everything up around 21, hitchhiked the States and Mexico, and ended up buying a one way ticket to India where I live to this day about 15 years later. It was so fast and complete no one really had time to process it. But it is the life I chose, and I'm so glad that I did.\n",

      "Ill be up front, if not a bit insensitive to some people - I think depression is tied to the lives we live rather than the chemicals in our brain. If you spend all your time living the life other people want, guess what? You're going to get depressed. You are very young and you have your whole awesome life ahead of you, man. I'm not sure what the life you really want looks like, but you've shared enough that I know it's not what you're doing now. Some people will be disappointed when you choose to be your authentic self, but they will get over it and the important ones will love you as you really are. Listen closely to yourself and follow your heart on this one, not your fear of upsetting others.\n",

      "Currently also in the middle of this, I'm an engineering major at a university, and I graduated high school with a 3.78 gpa or some shit like that. I was in the \"gate\" program as a child (gifted and talented education) and my high school career with AP classes made me feel secure in my ability depite the fact that I had high-functioning depression and anxiety. But college came at me like a runaway truck on a mountain, in reality I was utterly unprepared. In highschool, I wasnt successful because I studied, I did the bare minimum work to get my A or B and was able to do well on tests without reviewing. In college, this just doesnt work, even in the gen ed classes, and I crashed real hard. I realized I never spend time on studying and homework outside of classes, and the time I did have was made unproductive by old habits and general procrastination driven by my shitty mental health. At that point I was on year 4 of not having a therapist and year 2 or 3 of having no treatment at all, and the shame I felt started acting as a mental block. I stopped coming to classes if I was going to be late, and since I was a discombobulated mess, I was almost never on time. Things wouldnt get turned in and everytime I sat down to do work, my inner voice would tell me exactly why it wouldn't turn out well. While I might have had a better time chasing my musical dreams instead (I'm much better at practicing an instrument than studying), the problem is that I have a dream and want to make a significant mark on the world. I was to revive ecosystems that have been destroyed, help animals reclaim habitat, and help people affected by their ecosystem health with food insecurity, which amounts to a double major in environmental and biosystems engineering. If I fail, I feel like I'm failing all the plants, animals, and people I want to help.\n",
      "Right now I dont really have a success story to tell you, but I'll tell you how I'm making things work right now. The first thing was figuring out treatment and realizing I needed it. Thats easier said than done because it took me realizing I wanted to jump off one of the buildings to do that, so don't overestimate your ability to \"deal with things\". If youre attending a college or uni, go to the couselling a psych services, they'll help you build a plan and seek out resources. Im seeing a long-term therapist and it has helped tremendously. If you arent enrolled somewhere, your physician or health insurance company can also generate a list of referrals. Another thing I'm doing (and this might just be a personal solution) is setting up a routine. Starting tasks is hard when you have an overly-cautious side being fed by shame, so having a daily time to do things is like a que to just do it, eventually making it habit. Im still working on this one, and I dont have a set schedule just yet but my grades are improving. Another thing I personally needed to do was address my situational problems that contributed to all my issues. The hard part of that was breaking up with my long term boyfriend and moving out of the place we lived in together. This is definitely not a one-size-fits-all approach, but after verbalizing my feelings with a therapists, I realized it was what I really needed and I havent questioned my decision since. (Ok last thing I promise) One thing that I've been using to specifically target my depression when I work is to reestablish my reward-complex. Its very easy for me to disregard a bunch of work I've done as \"not good enough\" so I dont always get a lil endorphin hit when I finish things like I should. To combat this, ive invested in shiny stickers to place on things I accomplish, kinda like when you get a graded paper back with a sticker, except youre your own teacher. I also recommend the pomodoro method if you need to plug away some work. I would explain it here but this is already so long, so just look it up.\n",
      "I hope that in some way helps, its definitely been a lil theraputic to write it all out. Also try to ignore what other peoples expectations and focus on what you need to do to make you happy\n",

      "Hey I had the same issues and I recently figured something:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Growing up, I have always been told you’re a smart kid. And when kids are told they’re smart, something very interesting happens. They start to develop this identity, that I’m a smart kid. And they tend to do things that reinforces that identity, and stay away from things that contrast that identity. \n",
      "\n",
      "So If I’m a smart kid, I wanna do things that other people are gonna perceive is smart, that means things that are generally easier. As a kid it works out fine. But overtime I think I developed this pattern where I avoid challenging things, because whenever I do something that’s challenging it makes me stupid. And that’s not who I am, because I’m smart. So this avoidance Is baked in from childhood and affects how I move around in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hardest thing for me to do is something were I’m being observed by other people and I feel incompetent. Even if I don’t really care about those people and even if I’m not going to see them again. Basically it’s hard for me to do anything where other people see how incompetent I am. So I run away from all sort of experience that makes me feel kinda silly or incompetent. And that actually paralyses me because for most things in life, you’ll suck in the beginning. \n",
      "\n",
      "So how does one get around that?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think one way is to reframe it. Currently I tend to value intelligence. But what the world actually rewards is experience and competence. Because if you really think about it, lot of people are really smart, but they don’t amount to much. So I wanna reframe it from smart/stupid to experience / inexperience. More I can realise that my success has nothing to do with intelligence rather with experience / inexperience and the degree of competence I have, the better off I’m gonna be.\n",
      "And the neat thing about that is, the more I realise that, the more naturally I’d want to try things and be okay failing at them.\n",

      "\n",
      "Do you have any notions concerning the root of your depression? Is it simply the fall of your ego, or is it more complex than that? Consider your inner-most thoughts and feelings towards yourself, as well as the life you have experienced so far. What has your household environment been like growing up? What is the nature of the connections you have formed with your parents, family, and friends?\n",

Afraid that i cant be happy because that happiness isn’t real it’s temporary. But eventually, i started to accept the temporary happiness and once i did, more temporary happy moments started happening. I mean im sure it didn’t just start happening, I probably just noticed it more. Im in a much better place than last year because I started to look forward to small moments of happiness.

If a person decides their happiness lies in, for example, material posession or the satisfaction of their own vanity then yes, those are largely priveledges but also rather empty. There are many who find greater happiness in life than those examples can provide despite great struggle, and that is because they have understanding of where real happiness comes from and how to nurture it.\n",

Healing is often necessary, but also the hardest of tasks as it requires that we face our deepest pains and fears. I don't like to pitch religion, but the spiritual ideas associated with Christ are designed to help guide people through the practice of healing themselves. Even if you have no interest in religious practices, understanding of the concept of loving yourself as a way of unlocking the door to the path of healing can be found easily.\n",

The way to handle your fighting attitude is breathing, listen to what someone says and take a minute before responding, you are allowing an emotional response to become your first response. You arent unhappy. You are happy. You have an overactive anxious thought pattern which makes your emotions respond first. This is normal.\n",

In general (let's say depression and anxiety) you can start acting now while waiting to see professional. There are tons of wats to do so  Far too many for me to list. The professional you might see can be a psychiatrist or a clinical psychologist, you might see a therapist or somebody else depending on your situation and needs.

What keeps me going is doing things I like doing. I like looking at art, so I'm learning how to paint. I like looking at plants and I find peace within nature, so I am gonna take up gardening. I like reptiles, I owned a bearded dragon for many years and was able to love it when I couldn't really figure out how to love myself. I wasn't the biggest music listener, but I found artists like Mac Miller who was able to convey deep meaning / relatable emotion through his songs and it makes me genuinely appreciate what others have to offer. My point is this: Find a connection, some connection, to anything. And focus on how it makes you feel. If you have trouble connecting with anything, maybe try to learn new things. Pick up a book about buddhism because that way of thinking can help you become more aware of things that are ailing you. Life can become dull, but you can simply refill it with color.\n",

She said his liver was failing, but he was great, just messed up because of the antidepressants she put him on.  We would go for walks every day. I never got to say goodbye. He just wasn't there when I got home to take him for a walk. Every time I walked along our trails, I bawled.  Then I picked up World of Warcraft. A tiger and I fought and I couldn't put it on myself to kill it. I succumbed to it killing my mage and I wept because it looked so much like my cat. I imagined it was my friend coming back to play once more. Now, if I ever want to see my cat again, I can just go into that world and be with him once more.  \n",

I hope you make lots of friends and get to show them around the little world that you create.  It's not sad or pathetic that you found something beautiful in this world and it happened to be digital.  Maybe one day you'll get to see someone singing on the waters edge in the outside world.  If you want to make a real friend, that plays Animal Crossing, and likes to sing, then I suggest looking up Ayytrae on Twitch. She'll make your day better.\n",

You could look for a hobby that takes busy time. You might not love it but it could focus your mind. Something like building a model or something. You can order online. You won’t have it to do now but it will help later. And last you can watch so comedy or anime that is happy and zone out.

      "I know exactly how you feel. I was very successful in high school. Once I started college I realized I was no long a big fish in a small pond, but rather a small fish in the ocean. None of the professors knew my name, all of my classmates seemed so much more prepared than me, and I didn't seem to be making any new friends. For the next 3 years of college I dropped out or flunked classes and was on academic probation. I even got in trouble for underage drinking which was put on my school record. My parents expected me to graduate early and be top of my class but I was barely even showing up to classes let alone passing them. They didn't know any of this because I was too embarrassed to tell them how bad I was doing. Now it's about 5 years later, I'm still in school, I changed majors (I was a Chem major lol nope) and what really truly helped me, was filing for disability due to depression and anxiety disorder. I started seeing a therapist and she wrote a note for my university and I was able to get disability accommodations such as: excused absences, note-takers, taking tests in a private room, reduced course load, early registration, and more. I also had a disability advisor to check in with and they really listened to everything I had to say about my feelings of being isolated and not a part of the student community and she helped me find ways to feel involved. It took me so long but I'm no longer on academic probation and hopefully going to graduate in the next year or so. I seriously never thought it was going to get better and one day I'd just fail out of school and move home. But if you reach out to someone at your school maybe it'll help you too. There are resources in place for exactly these kinds of situations. It's very easy to feel alone, but so many people have this happen and the earlier you reach out for help, the better. I waited 3 years to go to the student resources office and I'm very happy I finally did. It's easy to feel like the school doesn't care about you, but the people who work there do if you let them. (also don't forget: C's get degrees)\n",

The way I make sense of it is it seems those thoughts are a comfort zone of some sorts. I felt that if I were to try my best to be happy, I would maybe get disappointed that things wouldn’t turn out the way I wanted. I felt if I was happy I was more vulnerable to being hurt, so I just simply stayed sad to protect myself from the outside world. I’m not sure if you are going through something like that or completely different, but these self deprecation moments can be prevented. For me, I just slowly practiced being more vulnerable. As I did this I saw that not everyone was out to hurt me or make me feel bad. I saw I could be vulnerable with people and still be liked. As I slowly got used to being more open and honest with my feeling (both with myself and others) I was slowly able to stop self deprecating all the time. I still have those sad thoughts a lot, but not nearly as often. Either way I hope you figure out a way to help yourself and maybe feel a bit better. I wish you the best man, keep pushing :)\n",

I was scared at first when I started going to therapy because the thought of airing out my business to a complete stranger made me feel vulnerable and terrified. But once you do it it’s the complete opposite of that. You feel like someone understands you and you’re getting a weight lifted off your shoulders. Sometimes though not every therapist is good for everybody so if you’re finding that it isn’t working properly after the first few times you go then you need to switch therapists and find one who is good for you. Also this might not be the case for you or for everyone, but I felt almost like a burden to those around me who I loved and cared about by telling them my business all the time. Telling your business to a complete stranger who knows how to help you is easier than telling someone you love tbh.\n",

For example, I binge shows I’m really into with a lot of seasons because I don’t like people talking to me when i’m watching my favorite show anyways.

      "I am going through the same thing. I feel so pathetic and stupid. My sister has bipolar so for three years I never got professional help bc of my sisters situation and thinking about other people’s worse situations made me feel like my situation was nothing compared to those. However my depression got so extremely bad like so bad to the point I was barely functioning. I decided to find a therapist and after a couple tries I found a lady that has been a great therapist for me. I’m on medication and I’m doing better than I was. I still feel pathetic but honestly I think that’s my depression telling me I’m not worth getting help. It helps to remind myself that even though other people have things worse it doesn’t diminish my situation.  I need help. I deserve help. It’s hard but I make sure to do everything I can to make myself talk to my therapist when I’m thinking that I shouldn’t. You deserve to feel better. Maybe it will help telling your therapist about that. That’s what I did just two days ago hahah. It seriously helped tho\n",

      "Yeah it is hard to keep convincing yourself. But I think when you catch yourself saying or thinking you shouldn’t get help thenn you’re probably not better yet. That’s why I keep going to therapy cuz I want to get to a point that I know I’m worth feeling good and worth getting help. Mental illness is kinda deeply rooted in my family. So I’ve always considered mental health no different than physical health. If you break your arm you go to the doctors get a cast get some medicine. So why should it be any different for a mental illness. You go to therapy and maybe take some medication. The way our brain works is kinda out of our control. I mean no one wants to become depressed thts some painful shit. Sometimes the chemicals in your brain are off and you need medication to help. I mean always take precaution and make sure your therapist thinks it could be helpful and you aware of side affects of course. But it has really helped some of my sisters and it has helped me so far. I also strongly recommend when you take medication to STILL see your therapist. The medication isn’t just going to heal things magically but it will help. This is just my opinion but I think when you work through therapy and medication then you will see a positive improvement. It’s different for everyone but for me this is what has helped the most. It was also good to stop trying so hard making myself feel better all alone and let medicine do some of the work.\n",

As an adult I can understand and appreciate her decision, but looking back I can see how it impacted us three kids. We didn't have anything to anchor our beliefs to; we didn't have any explanation for what life is and why we're here. We have been more or less materially successful, but when you don't even have answers to the most basic questions of life, you will eventually have to confront that.\n",

      "I started to confront it shortly after high school. I took some time off, experimented with drugs, and started asking questions. And then realized I had no clue why I was here or what I was supposed to do. That question \"what is life\" rocked my world, I dropped out of everything, sold all my stuff, and started traveling the world trying to find the answer. Although I was hostile to organized religion, like you, I realized the purpose it played in someone's life.\n",

Then you can start identifying the important beliefs among those - your values. Once those are in place, a purpose will form. And with a purpose, aligned with your values, beliefs, and idea of what life is, you can form goals and take actions to live your purpose. So deprived of any sort of foundation, what are you building your life on?\n",
      "\n",
      "I realized a bit later in life that my values, purpose, and beliefs were there, but they all stemmed from the old American adage, \"you can be anyone and do anything\". And that is actually a terrible belief system because it tells you that \"being someone\" and \"doing something\" is the purpose. In other words, doing things that other people think are important is the purpose. AKA, being successful and recognised. And none of those people I knew who had some set of religious convictions from an early age swallowed that message as deeply as I did. They had their own issues of course, but they sidestepped some of the major challenges faced by someone who has no real spiritual foundation.\n",

But that doesn't need to be the case. Get a bit of money from work/jobs, distance yourself (moving out), or work a bit more, go to college, move out of state, stop interacting with them so much, or if your school doesn't give you help it's likely there are services out there which can help you like psychiatric services, or university services, or finding services once you can afford to.\n",

      "Maybe I'm rambling. But I just want to say you're so young, and life can be a lot more than that, you can be independent and away from these people one day (a lot of people stop talking to their parents because of toxicity) and that you deserve a life of happiness. Happiness isn't easy even without depression, but depression can be managed with help,  and so can the toxic contact with your family. There will be a light at the end of the tunnel, it might take work to see the light, but at some point not too far away you'll be able to start taking actions to see the light. Stay strong, my friend. I'm always here to chat.\n",

It’s just human nature to look for others opinions as a way to rank ourselves and to not feel at peace with ourselves until we please the crowd. For years I had a toxic relationship with my mother and my athletics, where I would allow myself to be bullied into practicing relentlessly and never feeling complete or good about myself, my skills, or how others perceived my talents because of the constant pressure that was set on me. I am just now starting to heal from that (me and my mom have come a long way together sense then) and although I am still somewhat concerned about the way people think about me (which is completely natural) I have found peace in the fact that I am the only critic that I should truly listen to, and if I find joy and happiness in something and I am happy about the way I perform, that is what matters. Because in my experience everyone is in a race to prove themselves to “the crowd” but the most peace and joy comes from when you can love yourself and say that although someone may not think you are the best, or love your work, you enjoying it and loving what you do is the only thing that really matters.

I had to break up with her but it hurts even more how she's moved on so fast when I loved her so much. She blocked me on everything so she doesn't even wanna be friends with me or anything. I try to not think about her but she's the only one who made me feel happy and its like a part of me left with her. I've gotten better though and I'm slowly moving on and I know you will too. It will take time but there's millions of other girls or guys out there that will appreciate us more. She never liked anime anyway so we were doomed from the start tbh. I thought she was my soul mate but ik my real one is out there somewhere.\n",

You can literally lay in bed, plug in your ear pods and listen to one and be done in less than 10 minutes, or do it sitting in a chair if you’re up during the day. They can help you focus on your breath, your body, basically the physical sensations. I find those types of meditations help ground me into the present when I’m getting lost in my head.

She has more money than most people, yet I know she wouldn't be there..Most likely wouldn't be happy hearing from me (not sure?). And that is a tough thought to deal with. So here I am, waiting it out. What will tomorrow bring? Then the next day? Then the next? Tired. They say smooth seas don't make good sailors, but I bet they make contented ones..lol.

Secondly I'll state that unfortunately I dont know exactly how your feeling but i do understand your need for ultimate connection with one person who can true and endlessly love you, for you. Its extremely hard to find this without opening up completely yourself as well, anxiety makes things in this spectrum even more difficult as no matter what you do, you feel people are constantly judging you, even if you know subconsciously there not. That's the kicker in itself isn't it. I would ultimately suggest starting several, small, friendship like connections with people who you will never meet. Creating these minor bonds either though online chat rooms or social media gives you the chance to open up without the feeling of judgement as you can discontinue any conversation at ease which gives you more of feeling of control which is also something you desperately need as someone with anxiety. Give that a try and see if it helps you to open up more and soon with practice you might be able to connect with people easier face to face and then find that connection you so desperately want and need.\n",

I think I found it one time but then it didn't last and neither of us protected what we had going. Remember, if you should find this, which you can, then enjoy it but know it's temporary.

The thing is, if you’ve never experienced depression you can’t understand it, and ignorant people, even our parents, will say ignorant shit. It hurts to be treated by your parents so dismissively. Since you can’t confide in your parents, this means you’ve got to take matters into your own hands and seek professional help. You can do it. In the meantime, don’t let ignorant  people try to dictate how you experience your own feelings.\n",

The reason people treat you differently or push you away is due to their own personal issues about themselves and more times than none they themselves feel insignificant. Your beautiful inside and out and other people will judge you a lot of the time due to plain jealousy, just ignore them and try not to blame them as they cant help it, just be the you that you need and let them do them. Dont worry about others and learn to love yourself and find what makes you happy before ever looking to someone else. Once you find what makes you happy and truly love yourself for you then you have set a standard for others as well. Dont let anyone elses words or actions affect you, you are brilliant, amazing, gorgeous and utterly courageous. There's no one in the world like you and someone one day will see you the same way. Dont ever settle, dont ever give in. Fight for what you know you deserve and dont let anyone stop you from doing it. You are loved, you are treasured and being Indian make you all that much more beautiful!\n",

It's not a mental illness or something that needs to be disguised and ignored by medicine. It's a genuine realisation that life is pain and suffering, and that we are lost here in life. And when we are lost, what would we do? We'd find our way home. We want to go home. That's all. But you won't get there by curling up and wishing for it. We have to get out and find the path.

My mother, her only daughter, was pregnant with me and grandma wasn’t having it. She lived another three months until I was born. My mom had me cesarean and had to be in the hospital for about a week. Once she was discharged she took me straight to grandma, who was in a nearby hospital. The staff told my mom that a baby couldn’t go in the room m, since back on the 70’s they probably thought it was contagious or something stupid like that. My mom freaked out,  but my grandpa remained calm and just told my mom to wait outside. My grandma was in a room on the first floor, so my grandpa quietly closed the door, pulled out a pocket knife and cut open the screen. He had my mom pass me in through the window screen so my grandmother could hold me. She slipped into a coma a few hours later and passed away. She literally waited for me.

As we were talking he told me that he used to own the Woodstock Album but had lost it And wished he had had it back. I told him wait a second I believe i might have the same record. When i came back and handed it to him his face lit up and then looked very confused I asked him if it was the record his said yes It's exactly the record. I said ya i don't believe there was another one made. he said No this is My old record. And pointed to the top right corner. Where his name and his old address and phone # were. So i said well i guess it's yours. So On the 50th anniversary of Woodstock and his 50th anniversary with his now passed away wife he I was able to give this gentleman back his record that he and his wife bought just after the concert.\n",

He fired HER because she refused to exempt a company that donated a lot of money to Trudeau's campaign and employed people in his riding from prosecution for ... bribery. In fact, not too dissimilar from how Trump fired his own attorney general. Now let's see, oh, the minster of defense is a sikh veteran... not so much. He was in the reserves, true, but never a regular and never saw combat. Then after he was appointed minister of defense he got caught lying about his achievements in Afghanistan and taking credit for other people's work. Whoops. The disabled Minister of Sport is not a disabled person or a paralympian. That was the previous guy, who was fired because some woman complained that fifteen years or so ago he hit on her in an elevator, which made her feel uncomfortable. The minister of finance was a successful businessman in the same sort of way Donald Trump was. That is, he grew up rich and worked in daddy's company.\n",

      "\n",
      "Long story short SNC used capital generated through public tender work in Canada to bribe themselves into contracts in Libya which goes against certain Canadian laws regarding corruption and eligibility for public tender.  Breaking these laws would constitute a 10 year ban from public tender work and I'm sure a bunch of fines and possible jail time etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "PM Trudeau pressured JWB into seeking a deferred prosecution agreement for SNC which would essentially allow them to continue operating business as usual.  Add on the fact that SNC aggressively lobbied senior members of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government to create a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) regime in hopes of avoiding any legal ramifications of their alleged corruption.  He did this under the guise of \"protecting Canadian jobs\", but in reality SNC Lavalin had over 4 Billion dollars worth of back orders which they would have been allowed to continue with regardless of whether or not they received a DPA.  \n",

She recorded a conversation she had with the clerk of the privy council Michael Wernick in which he uses veiled language to imply that not seeking a DPA would result in her losing her position.  She went public with it and Trudeau claimed breach of trust as a reason to let her go.  Keep in mind this is all after he claimed to be building a gender equal and diverse cabinet.\n",

Now, I've learned the concepts of Zen before, and I've practiced meditation from time to time (with not much success). But this time, I used a mantra to help me concentrate during meditation, to have less space for thoughts. And it did help me have less thoughts, and I felt I managed to be more present in the several meditation sessions I had today. \n",

      "Everything is falling apart in my life the past year- schooling, career, my parents, family business, and my health. I stopped taking care of myself which progressed to worse health. I thought I knew what I wanted to do for my career, but I don’t. I finished undergrad with something I hate and now I can’t afford to take other classes as prerequisites for graduate school. I don’t have friends really (well a lot of them moved for school/work and they’re incredibly busy now) and I don’t have family other than my parents and shit, they hate each other and on the brink of divorce. My parents bring me into every fight and I have to calm them down and that’s at least 3-5 times a week. I do have a wonderful long term boyfriend though (almost 10 years!) Anyways, I finally started eating well, exercising, and losing weight. I was in the process of getting a new job. Really tried changing myself this year because I was so done being so empty and miserable. I think it’s called being “passively suicidal”- I don’t want to exist, but I don’t want to kill myself. The idea of something happening to me wasn’t terrifying and I know that’s not healthy. A month in to getting better and my boyfriend had an awful accident and had to get emergency surgery for his arm. He can’t take care of himself like before so I’ve been taking care of him as much as I can. I don’t mind that because I love him, but why. Why did it have to happen to him? (Not that I want it on anyone else but I can’t help myself to feel this way) He was trying so so so so hard to work his ass off and better himself too. We were gonna both save money so I could take my classes, but now he may be disabled for at least a year or forever. He was self employed so there’s no workers compensation and no one is responsible but himself. We are both uninsured and the emergency hospital bill plus the physical therapy bill is going to be absolutely insane. We’ve already spent so much money on just his prescriptions and his one doctor visit plus just the usual cost of living. The motivation for the gym and taking care of myself is now completely out the window. This was just a rant because again I don’t really have friends or family to talk to. I really realized this while he was in his 8 hour surgery and there was no one that I could talk to. I don’t want to talk to my boyfriend because he needs to focus on recovering and doesn’t need the extra stress....but guys, does it get better? Any advice? Anything?\n",

      "Well, I went to a support group earlier today.  It's a fairly simple 2-hour group with about a dozen folks usually.  we do introductions, make some announcements, then break into smaller groups to talk in detail about ourselves, then come back together as a group and discuss more topics before sharing positive news and ending the session.  The support group is immensely useful for me.  I feel like it supplies exactly what I need.  And today there were two new people at the meeting I had not seen before.  I haven't been going long enough to know for certain that anyone I haven't seen before hasn't attended before, but it turns out this was the case.  Both of these people were attending for the first time, and it was pretty clear that both of them were attending at a particularly trying time.  They rated their mood very, very low.  one was choked up and sobbing anytime they spoke.  it honestly broke my heart seeing folks struggle so much immediately in front of me.  usually meeting are fairly reserved and although we openly and honestly discuss our depression, it's not usually an expressive mood, so I just felt extra charged having that emotion so bare in the room. \n",
      "\n",
      "anyways, I ended up talking with both of these new people over the course of the meeting and I was just so appreciative of their ability to show up, share things about their lives, and contribute to discussions with strangers they had just met.  My initial reaction was one of wanting to put my hand on their shoulder and try to comfort them. Of course, I had to remind myself after all these years of reminding myself that platitudes don't solve anything.  and so instead I just stuck to the format of the meeting, listened as best I could, asked questions, empathized, and thanked them for showing up and sharing as is tradition.  \n",
      "\n",
      "anyways, it just felt momentous i guess.  as I wrote, going to these meetings is already important to me.  I hate when I can't make one.  And then to see new people is interesting, because it's such a profound medium to be introduced to new people.  and because these new people were facing such intense struggle, and really being vulnerable showing that in public.  I guess on top of just being a great meeting, it was kind of significant because so recently I was the first-timer and now I got to help introduce some first-timers to what I've become accustomed to. \n",
      "\n",
      "During the entire meeting, I kept thinking about how much compassion and empathy I feel for other people.  I can't brag about it, it's out of my control.  It was so hard for me to sit in the presence of someone crying and focus on anything else.  and i've been that way literally since I was born.  anytime one of my siblings was upset/crying, it immediately distressed me, and I would get even more upset when I saw adults just ignoring a sibling crying.  It made me think during the meeting about 2 things: 1) just how absurd it is that we're able to go about living our lives and enjoying the things we're fortunate to have while people around us are suffering, dying in pain, starving, etc.  The notion that anything could be more important or gripping than the intense grief and misery that fellow people are undergoing, I just don't understand.  And the second thing, where is this compassion for myself?  I have none.  I am never good enough.  I am never working hard enough.  I am not worth the life I am afforded.  I measure myself against all the people I come across every day and meticulously note everything I am worse at.  Unhealthy competition with others; it ruins social interaction.  Dearth of self-worth or self-esteem, great ingredient for depression.  Comes from a high-pressure upbringing, but I can't kick it.  And somehow at the same time I care deeply about other people, even if I don't know them.  I mean, damn, that's kinda good but I wish I got some of the sympathy too.\n",

I landscape, so when I have a long sunny physical day I feel invigorated after, but the next morning the gloom and dread is back.

I was scared as hell to tell the truth, but I did, I told them I was having suicidal ideation. I got stuck there for a good seven hours til a counselor could talk to me, but my husband waited with me through most of it, once they let him in the room til he had to pick the kids up from school. Before he came back there, I spoke to a nurse, and talked about how I've been feeling these past two weeks: trouble sleeping, exhausted even after a full night's sleep, listless, taking no pleasure in doing anything, thoughts that I just want to die. It was scary as hell to talk about, but not as scary as I'd been feeling for the past couple weeks. He asked, as did the doctor when she came in, if anything significant happened two weeks ago. I couldn't think of anything in particular, nothing major.\n",

Then I remembered what I don't even know how I forgot. Two weeks ago yesterday, I finally filed the report of an assault that happened over two and a half years ago, one that I'd been stuffing down for almost three years. I had a dream with my attacker in it the night before I was scheduled to meet the victim's advocate to do the report. I had another dream with my attacker starring in it a few days after.

I kept reacting to it, but the memory itself was just gone. Even now, I keep forgetting. Not just that, but I can't remember last Christmas. Or New Year's.

All of the tasks seem difficult on first impression. Trying to quit weed and just wish I could go back to work so I can be normal again. This pandemic is awakening something I didn’t expect or want. Being with my boyfriend has been nice but I could use a good few hours apart. I have always known this but I kind of realize how bad my depression has been lately. If anyone knows of affordable psychiatrists I could video conference with, I would love to get on some kind of medication.

Today one of my old professors emailed me back and told me to “consider my schoolwork and job search as something I can control” and so whenever I started thinking about him for too long I would ask myself, “What can I control?” which made it easier for me to snap back to my school work.

I’m still exhausted over the fact that I have to take another risk like this if I want to fall in love again. To give a lot of myself and lay bare my fears, insecurities, and emotions again with someone completely new is scary. I think the one recurring thought that has been and will continue to make my heart hurt is that if I told him I wanted him to be “the one” and he told me he wanted me to be that too, then what made me not worth fighting for anymore?

I was gonna start seeing a therapist now that I finally have insurance, and now that's not happening. I guess it's just another sign from the universe that I'm supposed to suffer.

Not often, but every now and then, and when it happens it hurts a little deeper than most things do. I almost wish, for a moment, I could give her the insight. Show her what it feels like, so she knows I’m not just sad, or angry, or stressed. But that something is wrong and I don’t know how to fix it. That my own brain wants to kill me and I have to fight that almost every day. That I hate myself for things that I shouldn’t hate myself for. That I’m irrationally sad and angry and can’t put my finger on why. That sometimes out of nowhere I feel this indescribable emptiness, and I wish I could replace it with any feeling at all. I want her to understand that this isn’t something I can shake off, unless you gave me a new brain. This is an affliction and I can’t just get over it. I need help. I need her to understand me.

I just don’t fucking want it. Seems there is no better option, death is the only real escape from this fucked up reality. And to think that the afterlife could potentially be an actual hell.

      "This isn't /r/.relationships but I need to vent. It's really starting to hit me that I don't think my boyfriend's parents like me even though they haven't even met me yet. His parents have known we were friends for a while, but they were only just told recently that we're dating. They seemed hesitant of just us being friends at all which I understand because, on paper, I definitely don't seem \"good enough\" for my boyfriend, but since they've been told about us, I feel very judged and almost a little suffocated. My boyfriend's told me that they're very concerned \"I'll break his heart\" and that he's been advised to break up with me if he doesn't think we'll last so he won't waste any more time on a fruitless relationship. I understand that they're looking out for him, but I feel like they're not willing to give me a chance and are (hopefully unintentionally) setting the stage for me to be villianized if we ever were to break up. He's told me they're really curious about my schooling plans since I'm going to be transferring from a community college to a university at some point and they want to make sure I'll be independently successful and not just weigh him down and leech off of him. Again, understandable, but that just comes on a bit strong all things considered. It'd be one thing if they were curious about me as a person, but it just feels like they're trying to use that as a way to say he should find someone better and more accomplished than I am. Then earlier tonight, he told me how they don't like that I'm still working at my part time job in spite of the pandemic and in spite of the fact that I'm still dependent on my parents and don't technically need the money. I'd agree the store I work at shouldn't be considered essential, but it's just very strange to feel like I need to explain/justify my actions and situation to people who I can't even talk to directly and who I've never even see a picture of. \n",

I realized I forgot to thank him this time for listening to me. I joined a new discord server focused on productivity accountability and managed to push through on an assignment due tonight and that was great. Today (since it’s 12 am) I have to sign up for fall semester classes. Signing up for classes has always given me anxiety and he was always there for me to lean on. Now I don’t know what to do. I mean I do but I have always hated the process. I’m anxious about it because there has always been some problem with me and being able to register and so by the time I’m able to do it, all the slots with the good teachers are filled. Also my narc dad gets scary whenever something with a lot of money is involved and he tends to ask me questions I can’t answer and if I can’t answer them he yells. This semester will also be the first semester I’ll be at school without him since he’s going out of state for grad school. Talking about this is really making me anxious and I just need someone to lean on and tell me it’ll be all good. This is definitely triggering some separation anxiety in me rn.

I'm in college, I go to the gym, I play video games, I'm normally a social person..but I cannot for the life of me make friends. The reason I moved was to be in the place I wanted to be, and my girlfriend wanted to move closer to family, we have been together for 7 years, so I don't find it feasible to move back. The closest I got to having a friend group was with my girlfriend ex friend's boyfriend, and we really got along for about 6 months, he introduced me to his friend group and I thought that would be a start to making some friends, but like i mentioned above, my girlfriend decided that her friend was fake, and didn't want to be around her anymore, which translated to me being caught in the middle, and eventually my friendship with him faded away because his girlfriend instructed him to not associate himself with me, and I guess she gave the friend group an ultimatum to being friends with them or me, and they obviously chose them.

Then the thought that they’ll realize how crazy/damaged I am sooner or later and run for the hills, taking my secrets with them and only looking back thinking about what a bullet (I am) they dodged—and that maybe I shared too much realness with them—scared me to death and made me want to isolate myself from the entire world. I started shaming myself for voicing my dark thoughts and got mad that I thought I needed anyone else to help me but myself. For trusting anyone with the very things that eat at me. Again. And to know that they could easily leave whenever they would like to. Taking with them the little hope/love/energy I have left. I don’t need a single damn person, I thought. My abandonment issues shine bright at times like these. I sat in my room in a shaking panic as my mind continued to spiral. My partner texted me like normal and I felt even worse thinking of the current situation: me, losing my shit in my room for no goddamn reason while my partner decompressed from work and got high and scrolled through social media not knowing the horrible things I was thinking. My partner then FaceTimed me as per usual. I had trouble showing my face. I told them I thought I should probably get back on medication and started crying as I said it because after the last time, I told myself I’d never be on them again. I cried silently with the screen facing the ceiling. I told my partner I was ok and to go to sleep. I text-ranted my half sister and although she provided substance I did not feel understood and her stupid optimism annoyed me. I cried more. In fetal position.\n",

I thought of how dumb everything—including this past weekend, month, year, life—is and retorted that getting back on medication was silly and unnecessary and that I’m completely fine. This is a vicious cycle for me. I don’t know how to handle it anymore. My lows are so fucking low I just feel like I get more and more irrational each time and the thought of killing myself just lies over my head taunting me. I’ve been in lower states I suppose, so I just get scared thinking that any second now I’ll be writing a suicide note again. As if I don’t have control over that. If that makes any sense.

We joke that I just become the mom of the group when I'm drunk by making sure everyone is having a good time but honestly, I feel like no one really cares about me. I'm depressed and suicidal a lot. I wonder why I bother when, even if I know parties would legitimately not be as good without my help or hosting, I always end up feeling like an outcast by way of how everyone having fun doesn't necessarily mean that I feel happy. I don't just push alcohol and games at friends. I cut people off since I sometimes know their limits better than they do and I usually try to be sober by the end of the night to either see people off or drive stragglers home or let them stay over. I legitimately care about everyone and make sure everyone is safe and taken care of. Why do I feel so empty. I miss when I could have someone next to me helping me. I miss feeling like someone saw me and understood and appreciated me. Sometimes I get the feeling like it doesn't matter if I end up killing myself because no matter how much I care for legitimately everyone around me, not just in parties but in general, all I'll ever be seen as is someone who was nice. Not a boyfriend or girlfriend. Not someone's best friend. I wonder how often people really think about me at all. I'm just the person that poured drinks and ran around looking stupid worrying about people who can't even remember to use my fucking pronouns. Why do I care.

I guess being able to cry is better than being emotionally numb, but my reaction to the incident still felt disproportionate. I was crying a lot, like ugly crying in my car a lot before I could go home. I felt horrible. Most of the time I've felt good though. The Wellbutrin makes it easier for me to feel good feelings too, at least. And to be productive. I just wish I was tougher or had a thicker skin or did whatever it is people who say they don't let \"it\" bother them/get to them do. I don't know how to magically \"not let it get to me\".

      "Two weeks ago I drove to another city to meet someone I know. The whole thing did take two days and cost a lot of energy. A theater was selling their old costumes and I thought this could be 'fun' visiting it with someone else. I'm having severe problems doing anything meaningful with my free time, there's also a lot of stuff I simply can't do. The other person is my only social contact outside of family and I only see her a few times per year. For me 'this' is also \"practizing being an actual functionable person\", something I've been doing for years now. Trying to be an interesting person, improving social skills, etc. Neither her nor my family knows that I'm ill. I can spend the whole day with her without any problems but the next day I might not be able to open a door at university and go in. Being with her also gives me a break of a few hours where I'm not constantly screaming inside.\n",

We spent a few more hours in the city afterwards. \n",

      "Yesterday I hung up the coat in my room to get rid of the pleats and a bit of the smell. That was a mistake. Ofc mom discovered it, demanded to know what it was and saying it's trash. I already knew this would be the only possible reaction the moment I bought it. I got no privacy and neither does anything I own. Theoretically I'd have to put padlocks on every single drawer.

      "Guess it's my fault for not hiding it better though. There's no arguing with a wall. Doesn't matter what I say. Getting berated for over ten minutes over other stuff just because she found the coat. That piece of clothing was just another (very exhausting) attempt on doing something meaningful with my time, trying to find a reason not to kms. Or it's absolutely pointless and something to despair over, depending on my mood. \n",

Therapist wanted me to talk to them for help but for me they've been incredibly toxic and damaging in my life and I've been trying to protect myself for years now.

My uncle and mum have jobs, he has a wife and 2 kids to go home to, mum has a boyfriend that lives 30 minutes away. We are all angry and depressed. Today mum and uncle screamed at each other because they did not want to stay with grandma during the weekend (I decided to go back to uni, which is pretty far). They were so mean to each other, I was there thinking: \"If that is a family, I want to die alone\". Actually I just wanted to die. I felt like an asshole, and I was not even asking to go out to party, I asked to go and get an education, somenthing that both of them were able to get, while being full time students and not a partial care giver. They did not get me a car, as well, so they cannot rely on me if they need to, because with public transportation I take hours  to get home from uni. My other side of the family is so different. They have so much compassion for each other and me. There have been few times when their generosity and more than ever their attitude, moved me to tears. Sometimes it really feels so weird that they would help me like that, with a smile on and without letting me know how much of a weight I am. My grannie hairdresser came home to cut and style her hair, since she is still really weak. And while he was there he told grannie that everybody was missing her and he thanked her because he said that during all these years talking to her helped him to learn a lot (grannie was a teacher, and he dropped out of high school). He made her feel so happy and pretty. I nearly had to put the money directly into his pocket. He did not wanted it. I was so close to tearing up.

It's probably connected to fear of vulnerability, to social anxiety, it might be caused by my frequent self-hate, or over criticism, or lack of self worth (many sides to the same coin).  It might be the middle ground that is caused by a few things I already know about myself, and is in turn the cause of a bunch of other things that I feel like are in the way of me making changes to my life.

She messaged me 3 days before she died, thanking me for being a beautiful friend. She told me she was going to do it. I knew she’d been feeling suicidal but we both had felt this way before, said stuff like this before & got through; I doubted her seriousness & assumed this wave of depression would pass and she would overcome it like always, but it consumed her. It all happened so fast, and there’s so many questions that will forever be left unanswered. I regret not seeing her more, not taking things more seriously. Especially for taking our beautiful friendship for granted. I can’t help but know I let her down, I could have saw her more, said more in the moment, I could have been more supportive and more involved in her life, but I was so self centered. So blind. I let her down and I don’t get a second chance. \n",

Again part of me wants to keep him in my life - he said we could still talk and do activities like running/rock climbing/gaming and the part of me that wants to keep him in my life is telling me to do these things as performances to show him that I was the non-depressed girl he fell in love with 4 years ago. And it is taking everything I have right now to not contact him. I wasn’t able to sleep but at least this way I’m more on track to fixing my sleep schedule.

I had a specific friend help me write that message in a way that allowed me the most freedom, empowerment, and choice, and I sent it to him. I’m so grateful for that friend. Other friends that I reached out to sent me cake pops! While in quarantine! Before that, they were asking me stuff that I liked. I never thought they would use those questions to do something nice for me. It was the most thoughtful gift I’ve ever received in years. I feel like this day will be a really good day after yesterday. I know I shouldn’t be too hard on myself if it ends up the opposite. It kind of feels weird that I feel a lot better. I was expecting myself to be extremely sad for at least 3 weeks. I guess today is just a good day.

No more movies to like forward to, no records to order, likely music will stop coming out cuz people can't go to studios Both of my jobs are gone so I can't make money and my mom can't work anymore, so will I even be able to pay for my apartment in the fall? Will that even happen? Will all this COVID bullshit still be happening in August? The hope that things will be back to normal in August is literally the only thing I have and that'll probably get ripped away too. I can't do anymore online classes. What am I just gonna take a semester off and wait? I don't wanna do that. My list of things keeping my going is essentially empty at this point and I don't know how I'm going to live in this fucking miserable world until the fall.

It still hurts though and I can feel it in my chest. It feels heavy and it makes me want to take deeper breaths. The weather tonight is kinda cold for the first time in a while and it made me think of happier times with him. We got together in the winter and I can remember cold nights that were warmed by being near him, but I also feel heartache when I think of the all times I was walking back to my apartment alone.

I'm also writing notes to all my discord friends, steam friends. I don't want anyone having unanswered questions. I have never planned suicide before. Anytime I have tried attempting it has been in the heat of the moment, no plan, no note, no nothin. I miss her so much and its only been days since i found out. I'm hopefully gonna kill myself. And I'll do it just because there is the chance i can see her again. Never been religious... I hope that doesn't hurt my chances.\n",

      "Day 11 post breakup. I was able to do some work by myself. I listed two more instances in the relationship where I felt unloved/lonely. Again I texted some friends when I wanted to text him. I played some Overwatch matches. Deep down I still want him to take me back one more time and it’s exhausting to feel this way because I know it’s not a good idea and ultimately not what I need in the future but my brain is rewarding it. I keep seeing posts by people who are still not over their ex several years later. I really hope that this won’t be me but I really felt we had something special. When things were fine we would always do weird things and then laugh and say “imagine what people would think if they saw us doing this weird shit”. Whenever we said that I would always think “this is amazing, I’m creating memories with the person I love” but yet I always had a quieter thought of “too bad he doesn’t love me” that I always managed to push away. Anyway I’m definitely super depressed right now but at least I’ll be sleeping.\n",

Im just hopeless and panicking about thinking that way. I Just feel like this emotionless unmotivated shit. But its got to the point when i constantly feeling worthless and Just wanna talk about it. I told my boyfriend and i expected it would help because i think its a serious stuff but it didnt help. Im trying my best to think about stuff that makes me get motivation.

I’m trying to do everything I can to not be hung up on him in the future because I know if I don’t do anything about it right now, then I’m going to be heartbroken at everything he does in the future and he’ll never even know a thing... which would make me feel so pathetic.

I already knew I'd be losing my job as well as my market for my side business, so I was fighting the depression and anxiety of it at the beginning of the quarantine which I think made me mentally prepared for getting officially furloughed this week. The stimulus check definitely helped put me at ease, and I've been taking the time off to heavily invest in a lot of hobbies I've been wanting to catch up with, especially gardening and cooking. What's also been helping is practicing gratitude for what I do have, and that it's not just me or my friends or city, but the entire country. Unfortunately my roommates/best friends aren't doing quite as well but I hope that my pushing through each day and daily mindfulness exercises inspire them.

I still have not been able to kick my habit of checking to see if he’s online or not. He normally goes online to game but he wasn’t online at all for the entire day so that made me feel anxious because I started wondering what he was doing. I felt this way during the relationship sometimes when he would go hang out with his friends but my heart was always eased when he would text me that he was on his way back. Sadly I’m not going to feel that same reassurance tonight and I’m afraid that’s what a tiny part of me is hoping for. I thought a lot about him today as well and felt some pain.

They aren’t yelling at each other all the time now and have started to share the same bed. Back then their issues always found their way into my relationship and my ex would witness the brunt of the effects a damaged family had on a person. After watching so many self-help videos recently and hearing over and over that adult issues come from early childhood I just can’t help but feel like everything in my entire life has all been some cruel joke to me. When I was happy and in love my family fell apart, my older brother told me to kill myself, and I was unknowingly driving my ex away. Now that I’m depressed and heartbroken my parents are being civil, that same older brother got a high-paying internship and my ex is probably feeling overjoyed? Maybe it’s all just an unfortunate and glaring coincidence but I can’t help but feel like there’s a lot of unfair pushback from the world.\n",

How can people lie to you and tell you, yeah if you work hard enough, if you sacrifice everything, your personal wellbeing, your social life, to be the best student, then you will achieve what you want...nothing is out of reach. Umm...maybe in Europe but in America that's simply not true. Certain things are out of reach solely based on how much your family can afford. And yeah I could take out like $70,000 in loans for one year of school...but that's moronic (in relation to my program), I'm just gonna dig myself into hole and then when I'm a PhD student how the fuck would I pay that off. How am I supposed be motivated to continue pursuing my dream when even if I can barely survive my depression+school situation, it doesn't matter... What's the point, someone please tell me.

The office is only open one day a week for now. The moment I had taken my coat off and sat down with the others I began to cry, which I hadn't seen coming, but nobody held it against me. That's one of the many reasons I love them so much. I felt that I had no right to, because I know the terrible pressure everyone's under, especially our boss. She's responsible for everyone's well-being as well as our safety, two things that don't come together in this crisis. We all know that if she had the opportunity she'd open up at full capacity tomorrow. I could see it in her face. You just don't get cut off from everyone and everything you know and love and the day to day routine that gives purpose to your life without repercussions. I met with a friend yesterday and we walked around for two hours and talked about nothing. That was nice. It's her birthday tomorrow. I still dreaded going home, so I went to the community center, which was open. We had to sit five feet apart, but the coffee was hot and just sitting there listening to the others talk about knitting and dogs was awesome. Afterwards one of the others and I bought groceries for the weekend. I made meat sauce from scratch for dinner. I thought maybe I'd feel better if I picked up the place a little, so I did a load of laundry, loaded the dishwasher and took the garbage out. Today I took a very long walk, replaced the flowers on my friend's grave, bought a bottle of diet soda and fed the cats. Afterwards I made a jelly roll and banana bread.

I've spent the last month spiralling into a pattern of avoidance, even though all of my work can be done from home so in theory the quarantine doesn't need to stop me. I accepted today that I'm not just following old patterns, I'm properly depressed, and I don't really know what to do about it. The meds I was on had some pretty awful side effects and I've tried several kinds, I don't know that I'm ready to accept that I need help, or even if I have the drive to get it.\n",

One of the worst parts of depression is when you start to feel the first “signs and symptoms” and you know you just have to ride it out. I was in the shower and all of the sudden I could feel that creeping dread, and just started saying “no no no, please stop”. I got out put my robe on and just started sobbing uncontrollably. I miss everything about who I used to be...I just want to be normal. I can’t stop crying, and I just want it to stop.\n",

A few weeks ago I didn’t feel this way but since I’ve spent some time with my toxic and hurtful ex-boyfriend in the last month and took on some challenges at work my mental health has been deteriorating. I don’t know if I’m depressed per se - I more just feel detached, rejected, and hopeless. I really need someone to tell me it’s going to be ok and that this is normal and will pass, because I know it will.

I'm married but not happily (trying to work things out) and he's happily engaged. I know nothing will or can happen. I guess a silly part of me still had hope that we'd magically be together if I got divorced and he broke up though because when I found out he was proposing a few months ago, I fell into a really bad depression that I haven't been able to get out of.

      "So Idk where to start but I guess it started when I moved in with this great guy and then started sleeping with the roommate and then broke up with bf and he moved out. Once the bf moved I started sleeping with this other guy cuz he really seemed to care then all of a sudden the room mate told me he loved me and I didn’t feel that way at the time and politely told him. I broke his heart so much he broke the lease. I moved into the place the other guy I was seeing which was with coworkers. After about a month I started sleeping with the roommate again. 2 weeks after that I found out I was pregnant. I never wanted kids ever... I had a druggy mother with hiv.. I didn’t think I would be a good parent it’s my biggest fear bigger than my fear of killing myself and of being alone... anyway I didn’t know who the dad was... in the end I got an abortion. I fell into a state of depression my work started declining and then more people moved into the pace I was at. I had to sleep in the living room with 4 people next to a dining table and liter box... the place smelled and trash everywhere. My anxiety thru the roof. I moved into my grands... my grandfather is a egotistical rich guy who talks down to everyone and manipulates everyone by buying them things. He judges. I lost my job. The roommate I’m still with the only one now. He still loves me and is willing to work with me on my issues but won’t commit to relationship like I’ve told him I want and I can’t blame him. I’m a mess. I haven’t had a job in a month and I’m running out of money. All my things are in a unit so if I don’t pay I lose everything go own. This all doesn’t sound so bad but idk how to handle it anymore every time I break up with a guy everything just explodes into chaos. One thing after another... I’m sick of trying to bounce back every time. I’m scared to get into a relationship but I’m scared to be alone. There’s so much more back story but I’m just exhausted living thru all the things I’ve had to go thru. This is just the most recent. I was cheated on so many times idk if I can stop sleeping around. I want one person but idk how to be normal I’m sick of mood swings I’m sick of family I’m sick of living like my druggy hiv mother who’s lived with her parents her entire life... I don’t want to go sown that road but I really think I’m going to end up that way. Idk what to do ims ick of starting over and at this point I’m just rambling ims o upset and I’m just thinking I can go plug my exhaust and just fall asleep and it’ll and just peacefully end...

I know that I have a fear of disappointing others, especially when people expect too much from me. I know that my mistrust of others is partly because of me being taken advantage of others my age in the past by being intellectually smart but weak to social pressure (carrying group projects and the like). I know that one reason I have no friends is because I lack social skills and am not interesting, with little to contribute to conversations. I know that part of my insecurities is a result of being pressured to follow in my older brother's footsteps, to do as well as he did, yet failing to do so.

But I know after that one night, I’ll never be in that same content place for a long while. And again, she’s the only good friend i have, pretty much outside work. But I can’t talk to her about it, because all my thoughts are about her, and if I tell her my feelings about her, she’d probably send me away, telling me that I have to figure this all out before we could talk again.

      "Idk lately i feel like i might have depression, or maybe im jus temporarily depressed, but i fucking hate myself sometimes. Here are the reasons why:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. I have a family who loves me and i love them too but maybe not as much as i should?? I mean like deep down i really love them but on the outside it seems like i want hardly anything to do with them. I never check in with my sisters (one of them has depression) and i dont even have the balls to tell my parents like a quick “Love you” as i leave, i always wait for them to say it then say “love you too”. I also never really have deep convos with my family, its more like small talk. Well sometimes we have deep convos but not as much as i see my friends do with their parents. My dad and I have this awkward relationship, more of like an uncle-nephew who arent really that close type relationship. I fucking hate it. And part of the reason that i dont change it is because i feel like i’ve waited too long and i am not the type of person to express or communicate my emotions (so thats why i’m typing this instead of telling my family). But also i feel like my dad and i dont have a strong relationship is because we are polar opposites; im more of a “popular” (i hate that term) kind of person but my dad would always tell me how he was a shy kid in school. Now my dad will stir up a convo with almost anybody about the most random shit, he loves talking, but i wont ever talk to a stranger unless they talk to me first. Anyways, regardless of how i treat my family, they always remind me about how much they care about me and love me, which makes me feel even more shitty because i feel like same way but havent showed them, maybe even shown them the opposite :(\n",
      "\n",
      "2. I hate my appearance. For a little background my forehead looks like a butt lol but im not really insecure about that. Im more insecure about my protruding ears. Like if i were to have a buzzcut i’d look like a monkey. I sort of have a 2012 justin bieber cut (ik ik). Like my haircut fucking sucks but my hair is way too thin and straight to do anything else with it (ive tried putting gel in and it only works for like 30 minutes no matter how much i put in. And if i try blowdrying it back or something it always just falls forward again. I understand that i need to learn to accept myself for who i am and love the way i look, but thats a lot harder than it sounds when people are always making little jokes about it. Its not bullying, its more of like “friendly” teasing.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  I have a SUPER hard time finding motivation to do important things or things that challenge me. I’m lazy. Like earlier today i had an assignment due but i didnt do it because it was wayyyyy too much work. I do care about my grades a lot but i when i look at them and get disappointed, i dont try to change them by trying harder, i just loath and get sad about how bad they are. I fucking hate how i do that and i dont know why i do. i also can never seem to be able to push myself hard enough to do things that challenge me. Mainly things i just dont enjoy doing, like schoolwork. But when im working out or running, whenever i feel like cheating a rep or cutting the run short i always say this quote to myself: “A moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory”- Unbroken. \n",

      "I'm actually glad we broke up, looking back I wasn't good for her. She deserved someone who wasn't a curse. Looking back I see all the damage I caused and am happy to see that she's doing a lot better to be with someone that can make her happy and not cause pain.\n",
      "I think I finally understand what she meant when she said she was scared of me. She was the only person who truly saw me under all the layers, and what she saw scared her enough to put up walls and run.\n",
      "And I think I finally see what she saw, a curse of a person. A plant that was grown in bad soil and when moved elsewhere it polluted the soil around it.\n",
      "Looking back at my life I think I might be a curse upon others. I see all the damage I caused by just being around and this depression was meant to keep me away from others and not cause more pain than i already do. \n",

Of wanting somewhere someone there in the dark to hold me while I cry and tell me it'll be okay. Of hating myself for feeling weak for wanting someone there but being told you shouldn't depend on others and you should love yourself.

I still feel like I wasted my time and I still have never felt so unlovable, pathetic, and stupid. I opened up to him so much and I felt like he closed me like a book he finished reading.

      "Day 10 post breakup. I feel like this has been the hardest day besides the first and second days. I looked at his socials to try and see what he was doing, and I even looked at his summoner game history😣. I wanted to message him really badly so again I messaged his discord account that he doesn’t use anymore. Instead of telling him that I missed him I listed several instances in the relationship when I felt unloved, lonely or pathetic. I was surprised at how many I could think of in my head. I stopped after 13 because I felt exhausted from reliving all of those moments. I watched a YouTube video on how dumpers feel after a breakup because I just really wanted to know how he was doing but I had to maintain no contact. If the videos are accurate then that should be enough closure for me. A pattern I’m noticing is that my mood is great in the mornings, super terrible in the middle of the day, and random in the night. I have a headache right now and while I normally messaged him when I had random pains like this, right now I feel kinda indifferent so that’s good.\n",

I got some of my appetite back and I’ve been able to eat some snacks again. For days I’ve been debating on whether or not to send him a letter thanking him for all of the nice memories we shared. I think I’m now deciding against it because it seems to me as if it would help him get closure faster and feel less guilty about breaking up with me. I’ve had my suspicions that the reason he wanted a friendship after this was just so he would feel less guilty and while that sounds like a harsh judgement on his character, I can’t help but come to that conclusion after reflecting on his actions throughout the relationship and leading to the breakup. I put my all into us and now I’m left with having to find closure from within myself so I feel he needs to do that as well. We could be friends someday but I don’t think he deserves my friendship right now.\n",

Of classes are still online then I'm going to fall into such a terrifyingly dark place. Uuuuuggggh I despise life so much right now. I'm numb and miserable and time feels like nothing and everything feels like a waste and every day is exactly the same and it's driving me insane.

People I used to respect are spewing vile and harmful opinions and that hurts me more than I thought it could. I want to believe that people are inherently good, and I've been able to maintain that illusion by just avoiding people, but now I can't get away from them. Yes, I know that's ironic.

      "I’m 27. I have dealt with severe depression in the past on the brink of suicide. Because of God I was set free. I was doing great until recently. Because of the whole quarantine and corona it has me spending a lot of time with my family. All members of my family have strong personalities... and then there’s me a quiet, introverted, quiet, low self esteem guy. I feel like I do not belong in this family. I don’t fit in. My dad for example my dad told me the other day “You are not normal. You have to be normal. tell yourself everyday your normal.” I actually pray everyday that I get cancer or corona because I do not want to live anymore and I know my family will be better off and so will I. I saw the movie “Seven Pounds” today and in the movie Will Smith takes his own life by letting a poisonous jellyfish sting him while in the bath tub. I am currently trying to figure out how to acquire that jellyfish. My family always tells stories of family trips we took and they always forget I was there. They even say “Oh yeah I forgot you were there. I thought you weren’t”. i’m done living and just want to go. Everyday I wake up i’m like “please lord just take me already”. I would take my own life but i would want to do it in a clean way if that makes sense and i think the jellyfish would come in handy. I feel like Im a burden and a worry and stay in my room as much as possible to try to not bother or annoy anyone. I’m weird and way different than my family. I cannot be myself around my family because they are quick to judge. That’s why I want to go because I can finally be at peace. I always have to be on guard around my family because if not then I will be judged and questioned and it’s just too much to handle. Hopefully one day I’ll be gone and everyone including me will be happier and it’ll be one less burden and worry for me and my family. I know the world will be a better place if i was gone. In the meantime I just try to survive each day as best as possible. The only thing keeping me sane is playing video games. My family doesn’t notice if i’m here or not so it won’t make much of a difference if i was gone. If there was a service where you can hire a hitman i’d do that but in the meantime i hope i can leave this life soon. Btw i have no friends except one so most of the day i talk to myself, pray, watch tiktok, and play video games. No one understands me or tries to they just judge and belittle me making me feel even worse. I wish I had someone to relate and talk to but in the meantime my stuffed animal monkey will do. If anyone knows a hitman let me know or of a quick and easy way to kill yourself please let me know. God bless you all\n",

There were even flashbacks of times I forgot existed...why did those decide to just come out now? Then I had flashbacks to moments of this past year where sometimes it was warm and light. There was a silly thing we would do where we would pretend we were about to fight each other video game style. For some reason it would always devolve into us pretending like we were a devilish pair of chihuahuas flashing their teeth at each other before the violent biting would occur, while still keeping our fighting stances up. He would say so many times while laughing “what would other people think if they saw us right now?” I hate that it’s a possibility that the burden of subconsciously keeping all these memories alive is only on me, because he is a rather forgetful person on details.\n",

He’s going to grad school next semester far away and I’ll be tackling on one more semester at the same school. I have already pictured the sadness or longing I’ll feel when I pass by his campus apartment or the grocery store we always went to together. Or the buildings we explored together or the path I know he always took with his bike on his way to class. Or his department’s building. I’m going to pass by his old dorm room where we first kissed. I’m plagued with the fear that I’m going to be lonely and stuck with this longing that the now-vacated places and things I associated with him will be restored by him somehow. Like some kind of ghost. Because of my terrible mistake of committing to him more than school I’m afraid I’ll never get a chance to be successful, move out of my damaged home, and actually start my own life. Lastly I’m devastated that all the effort I put in was all meant to simply be a lesson for him in the end to be better for his next partner. I know I am more than a lesson or a mistake or a regret yet that’s how i feel today. I have no meaning besides being a lesson for someone to be better for someone else and being an example of what not to do in college.\n",

I am super anxious about this but it is something that has to happen anyway. I am not conveying much anxiety through my words but I’m definitely feeling lots of it right now. Some of his things are still there and I can already feel the heartbreak that is going to come with sifting through everything. He broke up with me before quarantine happened and then he moved out before I did so it really feels like I am picking up the remaining pieces. Can someone please keep me in their thoughts tomorrow 😔\n",

      "\n",
      "You should see my room.\n",

      "When I forgot to take meds it gives me headache, headaches makes me angry ): plus I have problem swallowing pills... \n",

      "But I enjoy showering, that warm water is comfy\n",
      "\n",
      "Now imagine not even having them at home in the first place. I'd have to go to the pharmacy first lol\n",
      "\n",
      "I haven't taken my meds in months now, I know I'm getting worse day by day, I don't get up, days go by and I can't get my self to get a shower my room is a mess, I cry all the time haven't talked to another soul in months, I know I need my meds but I can't do it... I can't even get motivated enough to do anything, everything is pointless\n",
      "\n",
      "I think you meant me for the past year and a half... sorry I’ll excuse myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "It've come to the point where i can't be bothered to take a crap, shower or brush teeth. I'm pretty pathetic atm but yeah. Is what it is\n",
      "\n",
      "Ironic, that’s what I’m doing right now. The meds aren’t cutting it so I don’t feel much different if I’m on them or not. The only thing my meds do is make me hungry, and right now I hate myself enough physically that I’d prefer not to eat, so I guess it’s a twisted kind of helpfulness.\n",
      "\n",
      "been feeling the same way, all i wanna do is stay in my bed whole day doing nothing, and everything makes me anxious. hope you’re doing okay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its 1pm and I can't bring myself to get out of bed\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, swallowing tablets physically hurts (medical reasons) and depression makes me go fuck.it and skip them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Me today and yesterday. It feels like the meds aren’t even helping anymore. Guess I’m just that stupid\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking my meds is one of the few things I'm still just about motivated enough to do (most of the time). Brushing my teeth, showering and stuff like that is becoming harder and harder as the days go by.\n",
      "Anyways just make sure you really do know that there's a bunch of people in this boat with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, I've been depressed since I was 8.  Just had the mother of my son leave me after ten years.  I've lost almost all my teeth since the whole relationship was a battleground, I never get to see my son, I walked out on my therapist the other day cause she slipped the door almost shut to talk to a coworker and I heard her say, I don't think I can help this kid.  I've stopped eating, showering, taking my meds, and leaving the house.  I get evicted in a few more weeks cause I'm laid off, and I don't have anything left to keep me going.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes but if I dont take them I'm so depressed I'll die by my own hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hate having to take meds. It makes me feel like I can’t be normal unless I’m on some kind of drug. And even then I don’t feel normal\n",
      "\n",
      "don’t have to worry about that. my mom doesn’t want me on meds for a reason she has yet to explain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meds ? What meds the ones thats called Anti Depressants or the meds like ACTUAL SUPPORTIVE FRIENDS who helps you through depression and actually calls you or messages you to hangout somewhere or actually play games together ?\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm so with you on this. Finally someone saying it other than reading up how people want their life back\n",
      "\n",
      "I have to go back to work in a week and I'm dreading it. I've actually been near contentment in quarantine. I feel like alone in my home I can't just exist. I'm not forced to confront the fact that I don't know how to be a real person, and going back to faking it is going to be exhausting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Same thoughts. But my nightmare would come back soon 😭\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, someone understand what it feels like to be quarantined. As an introvert myself, I really enjoy investing myself, getting new hobbies and maybe I'll start my own music career. Don't understand why some people hate this lockdown. Anyway, this fun time will be over soon. I will miss that memories\n",
      "\n",
      "Your feelings are valid, but have you tried to just completely delete all social media? I've heard some people have success in the regard you're referring to. Sorry to read that you're worried about this. Stay strong.\n",
      "\n",
      "You don't know how much I'm worried that the lockdown's gonna end now. \n",
      "\n",
      "Im not a religious person but my parents are so they force me to go to church almost every single day. I don't want to be forced to be religious. I hate it\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah. I actually feel alive here and there, and it made me wanna fight for happiness. I used quarantine to make 3D models, excersise and walk the dog on the path behind our house, which is away from everyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "I still am depressed, but I can breathe a little bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "COVID gave me a place to cover up my depression. Before lockdown my motivation levels were in the toilet and my semester at uni was slipping away from me. I had an excuse to hide in my room all day, so no one noticed i didnt want to leave. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now that its easing, i was petrified about what kind of damage had been done by leaving my head in the sand. Luckily im feeling better now and so far everything seems to have worked out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Man you said it! Most of the lockdown has been me doing college work, which was not fun at all! Now it’s been a week since I’ve finished up this semester and in the next few days the government will gradually be opening up the country again. It’s making me sad! I just want to rest!\n",
      "\n",
      "I also really like this. I had trouble of looking for jobs for years before covid. Nothing ever hit. Even though my friends say I have a good resume, even though my parents have some connections, I can't land anything beyond 2 interviews over the last 2 years or so.\n",
      "\n",
      "So with covid that pressure is off. I am lucky that since I live with my parents I have essentially no bills. The little work I do here and there helps me cover small things sometimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "But for me this crisis state has just been true for a long time before covid hit. So I don't mind not having to solve it for a little bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "It feels kinda nice to take the pressure out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel the same way. And that scares me. I was finally making progress with my mental health for 6 months straight right before the lockdown began. Now I am back to square one. This place is comfortable and familiar.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I don't want to live here forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes! I feel this. Quarantine has been a lovely honeymoon with myself. My mental health has never been better. I still have my issues, obviously, but they're so much more manageable with this lifestyle. I sleep from 9AM to 5PM, wake up fully rested, and I have relatively balanced mealtimes. This has been such a gift, and I'm savoring it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm very optimistic in regards of how home office will be seen after this quarantine. I believe the business model will change a lot and introverts like us will be able to work at home, at least to some extent and, of course, depending on the job.\n",
      "So hopes up, maybe the quarantine doesn't have to end and we will have more leeway about that.\n",
      "\n",
      "i second you on this, i hate my area to bits and hate coming out because i feel so alienated and lost here and even though this lockdown has come with its hardships which outweigh the good, the one thing i can take from this is that i can stay home and not have to be outside constantly around people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucky you.\n",
      "\n",
      "My life never changed in the pandemic, in fact right before it started I had a shitty \"vacation\" which just ended up being a week of me playing therapist for another depressed person. There goes my one vacation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm deteriorating.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to die so bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "honestly i feel pretty different. like having to go out and do things was the daily push i needed to feel productive and good about myself. ever since lockdown i have lost all motivation and it’s almost like my depression is working in reverse. before, i would have places to be and things to do and that really helped keep my brain quiet. when i felt super depressed it would be because i didn’t *want* to do anything and nothing brought me joy. but now that i’m stuck at home, i still have things to do, but not being able to physically go to school is stopping me from getting even the minimal amount of work done. and it’s not that i don’t *want* to do things.. it’s like i need the routine to make it bearable. it’s not like before where i could just force myself to get out of bed and leave the house to go do whatever. now more than ever i feel like no matter what i do, i feel unmotivated, useless, and just terrible all around. a big part of it is a lack of social interaction. i feel like i dont have any friends. anyone else feeling this way? :/\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, I can't fathom people wanting to go back to \"normal\" because \"normal\" was horrible for me.. for someone who is \"abnormal\", I guess.\n",
      "\n",
      "You’ve put this into words perfectly! I have been struggling trying to find where I “fit in” at in life. I graduated college 3 years ago, dropped out of law school 2 years ago, and quit a dead end job a year ago. After looking for work and finally finding a decent paying job (though not a great work environment), I finally felt better. Like I was living my life as an average citizen. I lost that job due to Covid. I’ve been home and have embraced the slow paced life. I have enjoyed not seeing people on vacation, or bragging about work advancements, especially after feeling like a failure for so long. I am 25 (yes I know it’s young), but I have no idea where I want my life to go. No career idea, no career goals, no ‘5 year plan’. The thought is mentally/emotionally overwhelming. During this time, I have enjoyed my company, and my family’s company. All of the outside pressure has subsided. I can truly live in the moment and not the stressful state of mind that I have been in for years. I’m not sure what the future holds, but I can honestly say I’m not ready for it 😢\n",
      "\n",
      "Can I ask why you are certain a fulfilling life is completely unattainable for you? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I dropped the \"happy\" because that's a whole other philisophical rabbit hole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, it's way too fucking soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel ya!! For me Zoom classes have been the best. Just wake up 5 mins prior, keep the microphone/camera off, just chill in bed half asleep taking notes when necessary, and leaving whenever you feel. No travelling, no traffic, no fuel usage, no rushing, no getting ready, no makeup/hair/clothes, no social anxiety, no interactions, no forced conversations, no time wasting.... just you and your mood fully embraced for what it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been unfortunate to have a chance to isolate myself for half a year before the quarantine in my home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trust me when I say that after some time it becomes the torture beyond your imagination. All of the things that you've been running from will eventually find you. Only this time you'll have nowhere to run.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fuck I'm envious, I've had to work this whole time, except I had to flip my entire sleep schedule and there's way less to do. Also everyone is pissed that we're making way less than people on unemployment (I'm not.) I would fuckin love to get furloughed\n",
      "\n",
      "Same. I've been able to start a regular meditation practice, lower my Zoloft dosage (hoping to continue to wean off completely), go for a run every day, transform my yard with new gardens, and spend time with my family. My husband and I thankfully are able to work full-time from home. My mental health has never been better, now that I have the time and space to focus on healing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Same and I'm practically agoraphobic now to boot. Dunno if I'm actually going to be able to go back to an office. I have panic attacks now even going to shop. Let alone sitting in a busy office for 8 hours a day\n",
      "\n",
      "for me, I don't want it to end because that means I have to face reality. I have to find a job, I have to go on with school, I have to figure out my life, I have to move on and figure things out. I don't want to figure things out because I'm clueless.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can go out to parks and public places that there are normally people in. It's so nice to get out and not have to see people and just enjoy time alone. I can play video games all I want.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I just kinda want life to be on pause like this forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why the literal fuck do you have to change any of this when the quarantine is over?\n",
      "\n",
      "I for one, am changing back literally none of the lifestyle adjustments the quarantine required.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've learned a lot about myself.  And that a lot of things that people think are wrong about me, or that I think are wrong about me... aren't. \n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe the only good thing about your experience with this crisis will be having your personal existence validated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ask yourself how much of your pre-quarantine life you, \\*you\\* feel you HAVE to go back to.  \n",
      "\n",
      "And only go back to what you feel is absolutely necessary. \n",
      "\n",
      "You can wish it to end as mandatory for everyone, wish for the deaths to stop, and still be determined to keep these lifestyle changes where they benefit you.  That's actually completely legal.  \n",
      "\n",
      "You aren't hurting anybody by doing that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that's the point of all this. Drag it out long enough to the point where people are so comfortable and complacent they won't want to return to normalcy. Can you blame them? Who really wants to return to full time slave?\n",
      "\n",
      "I too find solace in this mandatory solitude. No more feeling guilty for not being like everyone else; now you all have to adapt to MY lifestyle. I honestly haven't noticed much of a change other than longer lineups at the liquor store. In fact my life has honestly improved. I'm a delivery driver similar to uber eats except without the middle man. Only work part time yet make about as much as I would working a regular full time job. Was almost ready to call it quits due to orders being so low for a couple months. Though since the lockdown started business has been booming. On top of that all the things I've been warning about are all coming to light for everyone to see. People are waking up to the corruption and lies being perpetrated by the elite. No one with half a brain cell is buying this plandemic and these demonic neophytes are quickly realizing their agenda is falling apart at the seams. \n",
      "\n",
      "Though for me it doesn't matter what happens. I'm ready for whatever is coming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second this so hard, iso had let me not compare my social life to others and alleviates constant FOMO. It makes me feel like my lifestyle choices are normal and that self-care time is justified. Things that I usually don't have the mental capacity to engage with (e.g. small talk at work, hearing about people's travel plans, expectation to look presentable in public all the time, be interesting, etc.) have decreased, and I've been feeling so much better until now. I mean I'm glad the pandemic will be over, but selfishly I also wished it'd stay like this at least til the end of the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Same here, but my job said we may not go back to “normal” operations for a long time and will have many of us still work from home if possible. So that gives me some relief. For once the rest of the world is adjusting to the normal that we prefer.\n",
      "\n",
      "me neither, also cause not much changed in my life\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel bad for all the already struggling people who lost their job and stability, the few stability they had\n",
      "\n",
      "This world is builded so it cannot stop ... it's really telling\n",
      "\n",
      "Nope nope nope. All of my coping mechanisms had been based around distracting myself with schoolwork, hanging out with people, with the routine of life at college. \n",
      "\n",
      "Having to go home and do online classes has just left me alone with my own thoughts and made my mental health way worse. \n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe I’m in the minority here but I really don’t want society to shift towards us being more distant and isolated, isolation is what made me feel depressed in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also want the lockdown to stay\n",
      "\n",
      "That's a well written expression of how a lot of people feel, I think. There's a lot of pressure to appear happy in America, even if it means faking it. People get so uncomfortable acknowledging this idea that things maybe aren't as great as we're all supposed to pretend they are.  When you can confront and embrace that, you can move to the next level.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm the same. The worst will be the thought of how much fun others are going to have once the lockdown is finished while I'll be back at being the \"loser\" who stay at home every evenings. I was secretly content that others were forced to spend the time as me for once.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been away from work for a month and it was a nice change of pace. \n",
      "\n",
      "Don't worry though. We're screwed until their is a vaccine.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve lost all motivation, I don’t know how I will manage to cope when this lockdown is lifted.\n",
      "\n",
      "i wish i could do nothing without feeling guilty about it. if i stay home and do nothing my family would get mad at me and say i'm lazy\n",
      "\n",
      "im my case, not for me. this isolation is making me insane since i have no distractions. my thoughts are killing me with overthinking, anxiety, and sadness\n",
      "\n",
      "2020 is actually the best year of my life so far. I'm one of those types that can delve deep into hobbies and specific interests for years, so home life actually makes me much happier and calmer\n",
      "\n",
      "I completely feel the same way. I hope it stays\n",
      "\n",
      "OMG! I'm not alone! I just \"smile\" when people write me \"I cant wait for the lockdown to finish to return to normality\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I completely agree with you\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel the same way!! It’s like I don’t feel this pressure of having to go outside and be productive all day. I don’t have this pressure that I’m suppose to have a career (I’m graduating college in a month) I constantly feel like a failure because I compare myself to everyone and it feels so nice that everyone is in the same position and just stuck\n",
      "\n",
      "Then don’t let it. You can still stay in your house, you have a perfectly good reason to. The virus isn’t over, people are still getting infected like crazy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes I hate to be selfish and inconsiderate of the people who have died, are or were sick, struggling because of no money/ job but these last two months have been awesome for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the last four years since graduating college, I have worked jobs I hate and been miserable always looking for a new one. I chose the wrong job field and I don’t have the money to get a second education. I’ve been super depressed, felt trapped by my own choices and suicidal at some points. \n",
      "Over the last two months, I’ve been able to stay home, relax, get outside spend time with my dog who otherwise sits at home all day, read, write, and think about what I want to actually do with the rest of my life. I also will get the chance to really search for a job instead of taking one because I need the money. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t want the lock down over either, but not at the expense of other people’s lives. So I guess I’ll be grateful for the time I’ve had.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like less of a failure with this lockdown.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm actually happy for the first time in years. My depression is rooted in financial insecurity and the stress of spending all my time at work only to still not make enough to survive. Right now I'm pursuing my dream career of music full time and making more money on unemployment to fund it than I've ever made at a job.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just want to stay home forever. I hate going out, interacting with strangers, going to work, all that shit. I don't want to go back to normal. Just let me stay home...\n",
      "\n",
      "I’ve been depressed for years and even I know this lockdown is not good for people, you need to get outside be productive and work. This mentality is destroying the economy and it’s a cancer in America’s society today\n",

      "Yeah honestly it's been a blessing..a two month long vacation..and counting\n",
      "\n",
      "I want it to get worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Agreed. \n",
      "\n",
      "As someone with the social anxiety, I’m living the dream. \n",
      "\n",
      "But yes, my heart is also with those who passed away from this nasty virus.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand completely. It’s been great being able to avoid the triggers for my anxiety. But I hope you take the time to cultivate the inner strength you need, so that when the lockdown ends you’ll be better equipped to deal with life as it comes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah tell that to the people who have abusive/toxic parents and partners at home who they have yet to fully escape from. You're just being selfish by saying that. Some people were ready to have 2020 be their year and now that isn't looking so grand. You're lucky to still have your job while others struggle to even make ends meet therefore worsening their depression.\n",

      "I can relate to this so much...\n",
      "\n",
      "Same. working from home has been pretty great, I can be just as productive but not feel exhausted by mandatory hours on my less busy days. I also have managed to pick up not one but two new hobbies while having extra time at home and I am super sad that we're returning to a half normal work schedule.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The only good thing about things starting to reopen is that I can go back to my new therapist. video calls with people I don't really know give me some mad anxiety so I haven't been able to 'go'.

Best of luck to you. Just take the first step\n",

      "\n",
      "I don't care what they do, I will isolate myself for my own mental healt. Anyways as I told you, we never come back to *\"normality\"* after this and I'm so glad fo that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you thank you thank you for saying this out loud!! 😭 I feel this. I feel bad for thinking this way but also a bit like “finally it’s not just me who get to experience something that’s not that funny and mess up your plans living in a constant fog of not knowing how long this will continue” kinda thoughts just give me comfort that I’m not miserable alone\n",

In other words, doing things that other people think are important is the purpose. AKA, being successful and recognised.

They put their arms through the cage (she won't bite them), and they soothe her the best way they can. But the bell rings or the horn blows and the zoo closes, and they go.

So like if the system is telling you “work hard, get a nice job and have kids, it’s the way just keep at it” women are more likely to go with that and that’s enough for them. Second, masculinity is totally at odds with modernity and is in perpetual crisis. It weakened (and, in the West, we became affluent) enough for women to reinvent femininity into something strong and proud. Not so with men.

I had plans to kill myself before reaching the age I'm at now, and just floated through adolescence waiting for an \"untimely\" death. I didn't find it. I instead found pot, and the joys of abusing it. I didn't magically want to live now, I was just too numbed to want death as much, distracted is a better word really. I got into a seriously unhealthy relationship, and began to sell weed around town and manage at a local mcdonalds I had been on and off working at throughout highschool. Senior year rolled around and I attended nightschool to make more room for working and selling. At this point my siblings had moved out (I'm the youngest) and it was just my very ill and downward spiraling mother, who was always gone, and I. I graduated, and got cheated on which launched me down a horrible, horrible rabbit hole for a long time.

I stopped caring.

I had a bucket of problems I hadn’t addressed for so long and I was finally somewhat self aware, I just took the most pressing of those problems and worked on it until it was solved and I felt like a weight was lifted. Afterwards I asked myself “why didn’t I just do this sooner?” All it took was for me to confront my problems one at a time and just try. Ever since I’ve worked on one problem at a time, paced myself, and slowly felt better over time. I had to genuinely want better for myself, and I had to be the one to make that decision.

As if everything played out the only way it was going to. I didn’t have the answers then, I couldn’t have known how I’d feel and think years later after finally gaining some clarity, and even if someone laid it out right in front of me back then I probably wouldn’t have understood or even cared. And even though I understand this, I still hate myself. I know dwelling on the past does nothing but make me feel worse and waste more time. I’m trying to turn that feeling into something productive, with the lessons I’ve learned, to get my life back on track. Progress is slow but the closer I get to a goal the more self forgiveness and confidence I feel, and slowly I start to believe in myself which motivates me to press on. Almost as if I had to suffer to make me who I am today, a better me. And maybe if I fully achieve my goals this self hate will fade entirely and I can feel proud again.

      "For a long time in my life I put others acceptance of me and others judgement of what I do and how I act far above mine, I still very much do sometimes, and that’s what’s hard. It’s just human nature to look for others opinions as a way to rank ourselves and to not feel at peace with ourselves until we please the crowd. For years I had a toxic relationship with my mother and my athletics, where I would allow myself to be bullied into practicing relentlessly and never feeling complete or good about myself, my skills, or how others perceived my talents because of the constant pressure that was set on me. I am just now starting to heal from that (me and my mom have come a long way together sense then) and although I am still somewhat concerned about the way people think about me (which is completely natural) I have found peace in the fact that I am the only critic that I should truly listen to, and if I find joy and happiness in something and I am happy about the way I perform, that is what matters. Because in my experience everyone is in a race to prove themselves to “the crowd” but the most peace and joy comes from when you can love yourself and say that although someone may not think you are the best, or love your work, you enjoying it and loving what you do is the only thing that really matters.

Secondly I'll state that unfortunately I dont know exactly how your feeling but i do understand your need for ultimate connection with one person who can true and endlessly love you, for you. Its extremely hard to find this without opening up completely yourself as well, anxiety makes things in this spectrum even more difficult as no matter what you do, you feel people are constantly judging you, even if you know subconsciously there not. That's the kicker in itself isn't it. I would ultimately suggest starting several, small, friendship like connections with people who you will never meet. Creating these minor bonds either though online chat rooms or social media gives you the chance to open up without the feeling of judgement as you can discontinue any conversation at ease which gives you more of feeling of control which is also something you desperately need as someone with anxiety. Give that a try and see if it helps you to open up more and soon with practice you might be able to connect with people easier face to face and then find that connection you so desperately want and need.\n",

I think I found it one time but then it didn't last and neither of us protected what we had going. Remember, if you should find this, which you can, then enjoy it but know it's temporary.

It's not a mental illness or something that needs to be disguised and ignored by medicine. It's a genuine realisation that life is pain and suffering, and that we are lost here in life. And when we are lost, what would we do? We'd find our way home. We want to go home. That's all. But you won't get there by curling up and wishing for it. We have to get out and find the path.

      "I was born in 1993 and have been living my whole life with depressive issues.  In 2015 I asked my doctor to be on anti-depressants and they prescribed Sertraline.  In 2016 I went to another doctor and told them that I thought Sertraline didn't do anything and I wanted to try something else.  They recommended Trintellix and I tried it.  I thought it was helping me even though I'd still get depressed so I kept taking it but a few months later I got my first ever suicidal thought.  Kept taking it and a few months later I'm planning my death.  Around July/August of 2017 I was still taking Trintellix and I felt as though I was two weeks away from taking my life.  I was severely depressed and in a total state of Hell.\n",
      "I stop taking Trintellix because it finally occurs to me that the medication is not working for me.  I stopped taking any anti-depressant for another year.  Another year of severe depression and then in July 2018 I tried Sertraline again and it took me out of Hell.  For the first time in my entire life I felt seriously well and I wasn't depressed every single day.\n",

      "Depression is a complicated thing that is not 100% understood yet, but to answer your question, yes, people do recover from depression. It's all about learning how to manage your symptoms (a process that is different for everyone) and knowing how to keep the symptoms away. Understand that it's IMPOSSIBLE to be 100% happy all your life, and you shouldn't expect that from yourself. However, it also isn't normal to be unhappy all the time, which is what depression is. Remember, you yourself are not your depression. Depression is an illness, and something that has to be treated. Something interesting to know about depression that was recently discovered is that the brain works like a muscle, and what i mean by that is that the more depressive thoughts the brain has, the better it gets at staying depressed. ALSO, the more positive thoughts the brain has, the better it is at staying positive. Part of getting out of depression is retraining your brain to be more possitive, and this can be accomplished with medication, but most importantly with life-style changes. For me, I've been having to retrain my brain to be more positive rather than negative. For me, this looks like meditating everyday, paying attention to my negative thoughts, challenging their logic, and replacing them with more positive ones. The most important thing you can do to yourself is to be KIND and GENTLE with yourself. Treat yourself like a friend. Would you ever tell your friend that their worthless, that their better off dead, that their not worth the time? I sure hope not. Every person is valuable because of the fact that their alive and here now. Be kind to yourself and others, and hold onto hope, because the world is an interesting place where anything can happen. Probably the most important thing to remember is that recovery takes time and a lot of it. You have to be patient, you will not see overnight results. Also, recovery is not linear, there will be good days, bad days, good weeks, bad weeks, etc., but overall there is progression. There's lots of tips online to help you recover, you're never alone in your struggles. A therapist is VERY helpful, and never be afraid to try medicine. I know this was long but I hope it helps, people do recover.\n",

I know your worried about your parent getting upset and not treating you the same anymore if you open up to them, I'd suggest you find someone your extremely close to whether it be family member, friend or even stranger (school counselor or health nurse) sit them down and let them know that you need to discuss something very important with them and that you wish for them to listen without judgement,  if they care like you know they do they will listen and respect you no matter what. This first step you've already made by admitting you are uncomfortable with this disease you are suffering from now you need to open up and have someone also know that you need to be comforted and helped in getting though this hard time in your life.

So many friendships these days are platonic and the word friend has honestly lost all meaning.

Maybe they have a lot of their own shit going on and what you have to say only reminds them of their issues and is too much for them to handle.

There is nothing worth living for unless you make it worth living for. You need to find something, no matter how big or small that moves, be it music, nature, games, reading, just find the small little tide bit of something that truly makes you feel even a glimmer of hope and cling to that. That darling is your reason, hold onto it and never let anyone tell you any different.

Cling to that hope, that enjoyment and embrace that feeling. That's your happiness, your glimmer. That feeling will begin to manifest into something bigger over time and help you to bring that light into other things in your life. Everything that we feel or do either brings us wanted or unwanted feelings but each different emotion shapes our live differently and for the better. It's what will create you, the best you, someone you'll be proud of and honestly your the only one who will love you with true unconditional love. Love yourself for everything you are and dont let anyone tell you any different, each one of us is completely different, so just be you, but always be happy just being you.

Suicide thought no matter how big or small never go away as it's just another part of depression and anxiety, just remember that it is in fact a disability and something she cant change and no matter the amount of help you receive it will never truly go away for good.

If you want to talk openly without judgement that's what they are there for and all you need to say before your session is that you require them to keep this between just the two of you. You need to have a trust between your therapist and yourself or you'll never be able to freely talk to them about anything as you'll always feel like your being betrayed. This is why it has not been helping and in fact making it worse. You have every right to refuse to speak to someone you dont connect with, like stated before they are there for you, not the other way around. You feelings my dear a valid and you should never ever push them aside or think you'll disappoint anyone or anything. If someone cant handle your feelings then they dont deserve you.

So what happens when you get paid just barely enough to survive but not enough to enjoy life or have any chance of getting out of your situation? You are a modern serf. A mere tool for the rich. What do you think is going to happen to the mass of useless populus once robots start taking our jobs and they get us on UBI? The entire reason capitalism works is because the one thing you have to sell to capitalists (besides the product if your labour if you're a tradesman) is that you have labour (time) to sell to capitalists so you can make their product better and faster than they would otherwise. If you have no labour to sell, if the mass of humanity has no labour to sell, why are you still alive, breathing all the precious air, drinking all the precious freshwater, eating all the precious food? The only thing keeping you alive at that point would be money taxed from the rich, and if they're willing to let people fall into the gears of capitalism and get mercilessly ground into paste on the daily just to have a couple hundred bucks worth of product, I'm sure it won't be a problem in the future.\n",

With early trauma, it can take awhile to heal and it never feels fast enough. I was emotionally abused growing up, and I was always told to not let it bother me. I tried, but I just hated myself that I couldn’t. I finally forgave myself for not just getting over it. It did affect me, and it hurt, and it can affect you after the event.

I to have depression but I have a cat and a dog ONLY because I have a long term SO I live with who cares for them primarily, because I usually can’t even care for myself. But one thing that I do on my own to feed that part of is that wants to care and love something special is plants! I have killed several plants by accident because I didn’t know what I was doing and I felt horrible about it but I decided to not give up and really do some research and get a handle on how to not mess up this time around. Idk what it is about these little leafy loves but I absolutely adore them and I stare at them, smell them, touch them, sing to them /talk to them (is a loving way when watering and pruning) and they bring my so much joy and make me feel like at very least I can keep a dang house plant alive I can’t be as bad at life as I think I am. Anyways plants for me are a really fun and helpful hobby when it comes to spending time on positive things. Maybe plants aren’t your thing maybe your thing is fish or maybe it’s something completely undiscovered yet, but if it brings you joy don’t give up on it even if you hit snags or mess something up. I’m sure your bubbly friends lived and appreciated you for the good life you gave them and the heater thing is totally unforeseeable and 100%. NOT your fault at all (even if it feels that way).

On the one hand i'm annoyed because i was trying to see friends again, and reconnect with people i drifted away from as a result of the abuse. But on the other hand the pressure to get my future sorted is a lot less, because the world is basically fucked right now. In all honestly this lock down reminds me of my abusive relationship, never being allowed to go out is exactly what i went through, and a part of my brain is kind of liking the fact that everyone is getting a taste of what i went through.

That was my biggest issue, not having confidence or integrity for myself. Master your actions, your body, your spirit, and then you’ll feel in control. Discipline is freedom my friend. There’s nothing fucking wrong with being a lone wolf, but it’s an issue if you keep feeling sorry for yourself and blaming everything but YOURSELF for your circumstances. I highly recommend the book “The 7 habits of highly effective people” by Stephen R. Covey, It’s your choice to read it or not but what do you have to lose.

      "\n",
      "Here are some things I started doing that I believe that will help you achieve this: \n",
      "\n",
      "• **SELF-KNOWLEGE -** Take half hour of your day to answer a self-discovery question. It'll allow you unlock your authentic self. If you go to Pinterest or Google Images, you'll find a sequence of pins called *\"365 Days For A Better You\"* that go from January to December, that'll be a great start. In a year from now, answer them again and compare your progress. \n",
      "\n",
      "• **STOP COMPARING -** One thing you should stop doing during this time is comparing yourself to others. It won't do you any good, and keep you from making spiritual progress. So, it's good to stay away from social media if that makes you see people who seem to have a greener grass and think *\"Oh, how my life sucks! That should be me if this and that\"*. It's time to learn to love yourself, remove this from your routine! \n",
      "\n",
      "• **BECOME INDEPENDENT -** You seek other people or run away from them because deep down you want a connection. But it won't be a healthy one if you think that you'll find your happiness in them. Instead of doing either of these things (seeking or running away), take a break and decide to work to become independent. Through studying and working, as well as through working on becoming the best version of you. \n",
      "\n",
      "• **CONNECT -** That doesn't mean you should stop connecting altogether, though. Even if you can't touch them because of the virus, spend more time with your family - and, those of you who have friends, with them too. If you stop thinking about yourself only, you'll heal the pains of others around you and promote a better environment for everyone. Like, for example, my aunt was stressed all the time the other day, so I got up and started helping her with home chores. Guess what? She was much happier before which reduced tension at home and avoided some arguments, lol. \n",
      "\n",
      "• **PLAN YOUR GOALS -** I know it's hard to do a lot of things with the covid-19 going around, but that's no excuse to plan a routine and goals. With them you have a focus and spend less time doing unproductive things. Laziness ***is*** an option. \n",
      "\n",
      "• **HAVE VALUES -** On your search to self-love, create playlists that will keep you motivated. Go to Amazon Unlimited and get those 30 days free - if you can't afford it now - to read some self-improvement books. Establish boundaries to create relationships you'll love in the future... Like for example *\"the friendship code, or the girl code\"*, which are rules you need to follow to be a good friend. Seek becoming more ethical. \n",
      "\n",
      "In resume, take the time you have left to work on these things and you'll feel much happier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe the quarantine does give me some peace, but I don't like a quarantine with lot of people suffering and dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have the same feeling, but fail to accept it due to the burden of it being insensitive. Maybe it also comes from a place of privilege because I am not at a loss by staying at home, but people out there are striving real hard to make ends meet. Mixed feelings, but I thoroughly like staying home.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m in a weird spot right now with my GF. We live together but this pandemic has made us hate each other and has been too the point where once the quarantine is over I’m going to move out.

      "\n",

If a girl came up to me and asked me out there’s a 90% chance I’d give it a go regardless of what she looked like. That’s probably because I’m also shy and have difficulty in approaching people-because in all honesty, I’m a bitch-but you get what I’m saying.

Not because they are undesirable in any way, it's just that the process to find someone usually sucks and the sensitive people who may have some of the deepest love to offer are often bad at it. But from the few precious, fleeting moments of love that I've had (never a full, healthy relationship unfortunately) I've learned that it's too sweet a thing to give up on. I believe that you will be loved, really loved, for all the parts of your being. And I'm holding out some hope for myself, too. Don't give up.\n",

Looking back on it, I also got too lost in those jobs, swept away from the day to day grind without having enough energy and urgency to get out sooner. With that in mind, I hope you keep on the search. Maybe consider more education if time/money allows or have a closer look at your resume from time to time to see if it can be improved. I know this is a lot to ask for and I can definitely understand if the energy and motivation is not there--especially after a tiring day with awful customers--but I really hope you carve a way out for yourself.

If it's taking out the trash then maybe put it in smaller bags so you need to put it out everyday or you could keep it on your counter in a vessel(like composters do with kitchen scraps) and just put it out every night. If you miss a night or two no biggie, don't beat yourself up, just try to do it the next day. I've found that with dishes although it's terribly annoying it's probably best to rinse them out as soon as you use them. It takes a while to get into the rhythm of it but with consistency it does get easier(but not less annoying). Also maybe attempt one thing at a time and do it regularly for a few days before adding the next thing. \n",

I've been through it and it took a long time and a lot of setbacks to climb out of that hole. I still deal with depression but I've learned healthy ways to manage it.

      "So I think the thing is for people like us, we came to completely go through our journey of growth and meanwhile in depression. You know, all the moods, mindsets, confusion, to then learn and understand it, that's literally to be seen in depression, there's a certain capacity to what this illness has to offer. When you have clinical depression, the opposite is not happiness, but vitality. We could quite literally never reach a state of full clarity and bliss, but the paradox is that state of mind for us is found in getting on a set schedule for our bodies, making sure you're getting appropriate sleep, eating, putting yourself outside enough, etc. (Which I know you know already), coming to a good baseline on your personal thinking (good attitude) and the last piece you're missing is the one you're looking for. This is why, most artists of anything have depression, and alot of people who are depressed go on to make art, music, movies etc. It proves the powerful self thinking, you are it. You are it's creation and the creation. Doesn't even have to be art. Anything that expresses the dread you're facing every Day, that's what makes it have it's purpose for every second you live and continue to go. You've learned it all. You've fought it all. You continue to now battle at the highest point you could reach. But it's not worth shit to us if we're going to continue to fight it and not make it INTO something. Society is designed for the modern idiot. We will never feel fulfilled in it because it's nothing new, and we know this. And we're here to create more than that. Find what you're here to create in expressing what you face. You're putting up the best fight you ever have with your depression, and expressing that is what makes getting through the tough moments and being the powerhouses we are actually matter. Matter in our OWN heads. The only one that does matter. And if you atleast tried, you did your best and I'm proud of you for that.\n",

My mom always told me, there are enough people in this world willing to beat you up, you can't be one of them and beat yourself up. You used a lot a phrases like a part of me believes. That seems like trying to have it both ways. You know you have a disease but you're also allowing yourself to give in to the disease when it lies and says it's just a character flaw. You have to aggressively go after that idea and eradicate it. Give it no space in your thoughts. You have a disease. You are deserving of the same compassion and understanding that anyone with an illness is. And anyone who doesn't get that is just ignorant. And you better be ready because I don't believe that the well can ever understand the mentally ill, no matter how much they may want to our try to.

In that case, you can also see working hard as some kindness you can do to yourself, because the world sure ain't going to stop over your plight. That's the key I think, treating the grind as being kind to yourself, I mean you're the one trying to get through higher education, and presumably, you want to see it to the end and don't want the effort spent to go to waste, so what else can you do but do your work for you?\n",

I'm only still in college because I think some kind of degree would be better than no degree at all when it comes to full-time job opportunities.

After dealing with increasing hopelessness and sadness, it feels like that's the only thing I'll ever feel anymore.

Each week's material for each unit had a single page of notes.  My best tip was that, with each term going for twelve weeks, I'd divide a piece of paper into six, and every week I'd put into one of those squares the five or ten most important things of the week.

I used to beat myself up and take all the blame because I wasn’t working hard enough. I’m in my second year of university right now, and this year I broke down. Because of my depression, some days I went to bed straight from classes, didn’t eat, didn’t study, and just slept until the morning when I had to get up. I felt extremely guilty doing this, because I could be using my time to write an essay, or complete an assignment. But instead I just slept away the precious time. But the anxiety side and my fear of failing/disappointment kept me going I guess. It is not a good mix to have both illnesses but I guess this might be an advantage.

It really should be mandatory if you're a mild-mannered person. I wish I could go back in the past and tell myself to get involved in sports at a very young age. I might've turned out in a better circumstance than I am in now.

From what ive learned from both families is that racism is used by both sides to make it easier to be friends with their own or but its also mostly due to racism being around so predominantly when they were younger causing it to leak into their personality. You shouldn't hate yourself just because you realised you have a flaw we all have flaws and they all take many different shapes and forms. But we don't live life based on our flaws we live because we want to see that new movie with friends or try that food from Europe. But all in all remember we all need to feel emotions, our body just likes to make excuses for those emotions all the time and those excuses can take a negative form. But id recommend maybe a change of scenery and surroundings because when you surround yourself by evil its a lot easier to become evil,so maybe head down to new orleans and see why mardi gras is so crazy. Also a huge thing I forgot about is that we all think, see, and feel the world differently because of our cultural backgrounds so see why other cultures love their own style.

      "Now, about your SO. I think a relationship has to be based on trust. There's a million reasons she might be online after she said goodnight to you. She might be talking to friends about random things. She might be working on something from school and talking to classmates about it. She might be doing something else but from time to time checks her phone (I do that all the time because I don't always hear the sound of new messages or something). My point is: your gonna drive yourself crazy if you keep thinking about it. Specially because everything will be nothing other than speculations. And, mate, those thoughts are a bitch. They might even start as a mild annoyance, but if we keep feeding them, they can become huge paranoia. It's not unusual for someone your age to have those insecurities about their SO. But keep in mind they do have a life of their own as well. If it bothers you so much and there's the possibility, try taking to her about it. Again, calmly, exposing how you feel, careful with your words so they don't give the impression you're putting your insecurities as her responsibility, because they're not. There's a bit of controlling behaviour on your part, checking on if she's online or not. Since you told about your mom's attitudes, I guess you're telling us where this might be coming from. But if you don't work on it, THIS might be the reason you will struggle in your relationships. It might even become a greater issue in your life. As we get older (I'm in my 40s) we start to learn that any control we try to have (not only on relationships but pretty much everything in life) is very fragile. It's more an illusion thank anything real. We also learn that a true, meaningful relationship can only be built on trust and good communication. It's not easy. I still struggle with the communication part. So start working on it earlier than me and you might do way better than me. I hope you can work all this out with the best outcome possible for you.\n",

It makes sense that things are extremely tense right now as your mom is feeling very hurt by what you said, but it doesn't mean that it will be like this forever. Apologize to her and express what you feel underneath the things you said. Allow her to voice how she feels as well. Even if she won't accept your apology now or understand your feelings, she should get past this with time.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. Reminds me of how few people really care about me. Growing up birthdays used to be the one day I could count on getting some attention from people (as pathetic as that sounds). But now, nothing. I even used to make sure every day I got a Facebook notification about someone’s birthday, I would wish them a happy birthday, even if we weren’t that close. I did this in the hope that they would return the favour when it was my bday....but nope, I have gotten none for a few years now.\n",

      "\n",
      "My last birthday was one of the worst days of my life. I just spent the whole day crying quietly to myself. Nobody even mentioned my birthday. The most happy birthdays I got was when I mentioned it was my birthday in chat during a League of Legends game. Birthdays just make me sad and remind me of the year's wasted potential. The year prior, my birthday fell on a Sunday so I went to church. Not a single person wished me a happy birthday when some of the other kids in my youth group will be flocked to and sung over if their birthday is in a week.   The only person who seems to care about my birthday is my dad, and I'm very grateful for him.\n",
      "\n",
      ">I always think that the next year of my life will be the year everything in my life comes together and I'm finally able to live as a happy person. Every year I'll look back and lament that nothing has really changed and no matter how many times I try to move or make new friends or try something new in life beneath the surface I am still a deeply unhappy person\n",

      "My boyfriend's mum convinced me to go shopping with her even though I really just wanted to stay home. It's just a day like every other, nothing special other than a reminder that I'm still alive, my life is still trash, my problems are still as bad as before if not worse and that I have to keep on living and acting like it'll get better which isn't true (in my eyes).\n",

      "A theme throughout your post is a past history of toxic people and a fear of meeting more toxic people in the future. As someone who goes to university, I can promise you that there are so many different, amazing people out there. The best thing about college is that people are so diverse that you will always find a community, as long as you try. There's still hope, OP. Wish you the best.\n",

      "I understand what you are going through and I also understand what he’s going through. Depression doesn’t just make you sad, it turns all the negative emotions super extreme. When you feel sad, you get super sad. When you get angry, you get super angry. Your emotions and feelings are extremely sensitive and explosive. It makes you do things you regret and you black out. You are so strong being his rock rn, but just so you know it’s okay to leave him if you can’t handle it anymore. Don’t hold yourself responsible for him. Don’t forget you have yourself to take care of. I hope you both grow and heal. Please updates on your journey ❤️\n",

But sometimes you find the right person and they won’t stop talking to you, those are the sort of people you want to associate with, people that lift you up, people that understand sometimes when you go silent or MIA that all you need is someone to be there.

Maybe if your able to do the same you can make positive steps to get that motivation back. \n",

      "For me it was coming to terms with the fact that others have used my hard working and forgiving nature against me. My ex gf abused me for 5yrs, she knew i would work hard and make sacrifices for her. She literally abused me and my reaction was i needed to work harder to appease her, but the abuse never stopped no matter how hard i worked or what i sacrificed along the way. In order to cope with it all, I basically ran myself into the ground. I never saw friends or did anything for myself in order to stop the guilt and abuse. I just ran myself into the ground thinking my degree would make it all worthwhile. It did not, i'm 26 and with the world the way it is, basically unemployable. I know i will never be able to work that hard again, and knowing that even when i did work that hard and sold my soul in order to do so, but got absolutely no reward at all, crushed any motivation to ever work hard again. Other shit happened too like being reduced to 3 days a week at my first job post uni, my dad having a heart scare after i told him i wanted to drop out of my masters programme. Then to round it all off my friend of 20 yrs made my abusive rl worse when he told his gf about how i was questioning the rl and she told my abusive ex.\n",

You sound like you’re confident and known what or where you want to be, and everyone knows you’re more than capable of taking the right steps to get there. Be more assertive and trust yourself more, it is more than possible to restart and introduce yourself to a new industry you’re passionate in or interested at any age, especially at 28 years young. You have your entire life ahead of you, and life will be better so long as you’re working with the best you’ve got and never let the world keep you down.\n",

From the sounds of it, I don't think you're in the United States, but if there's a text line or hotline you can call, someone might be able to help you deal with this given that your school does not provide mental health resources. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think getting a therapist would be a good step after that, to help you work through your thoughts, etc. As for actually opening up, maybe try opening up to a friend first and possibly going to your parents together so they can realize that it isn't just all in your head and that it's affecting your schoolwork and that other people (your friends, teachers, etc.) are noticing as well. It probably will be a tough conversation, but ultimately necessary if you want to get the help you need. \n",

      "* not napping during the day\n",

      "Yes that's self Harm. It's OK, it's also one of my coping tools, I generally starve myself and let my personal hygiene go to self harm. Some people cut, others sabotage their relationships. Lots of self harm methods out there.\n",

      "As far as being tired that's not usually a issue for me as when I get into a low time depression wise I generally spend most of my free time sleeping as I have no motivation to do anything else and my two cats are pretty good at curling up in my arms in bed and purring me to sleep. Only downside to this is it upsets the SO because she almost never sees me, but, as I've mentioned to her a few times now when I'm that low she probably doesn't want to spend time with me anyways.\n",
